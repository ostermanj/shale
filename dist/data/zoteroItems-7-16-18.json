This occurred largely because of the development of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing which allows access to fossil fuels from geologic formations that were previously not cost effective to pursue. This process is known to use greater than 1,000 chemicals such as solvents, surfactants, detergents, and biocides. In addition, a complex mixture of chemicals, including heavy metals, naturally-occurring radioactive chemicals, and organic compounds are released from the formations and can enter air and water. Compounds associated with UOG activity have been linked to adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes in humans and laboratory animal models, which is possibly due to the presence of endocrine active chemicals. Using systematic methods, electronic searches of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify studies that measured chemicals in air near sites of UOG activity. Records were screened by title and abstract, relevant articles then underwent full text review, and data were extracted from the studies. A list of chemicals detected near UOG sites was generated. Then, the potential endocrine activity of the most frequently detected chemicals was explored via searches of literature from PubMed. Evaluation of 48 studies that sampled air near sites of UOG activity identified 106 chemicals detected in two or more studies. Ethane, benzene and n-pentane were the top three most frequently detected. Twenty-one chemicals have been shown to have endocrine activity including estrogenic and androgenic activity and the ability to alter steroidogenesis. Literature also suggested that some of the air pollutants may affect reproduction, development, and neurophysiological function, all endpoints which can be modulated by hormones. These chemicals included aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mercury. These results provide a basis for prioritizing future primary studies regarding the endocrine disrupting properties of UOG air pollutants, including exposure research in wildlife and humans. Further, we recommend systematic reviews of the health impacts of exposure to specific chemicals, and comprehensive environmental sampling of a broader array of chemicals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Health","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"26","date":"2018/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","ISSN":"1476-069X","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","accessDate":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ehjournal.biomedcentral.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s).","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateModified":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateString":"December 2018","dateValue":"2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"5VJ2Q7RE","version":1575,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5VJ2Q7RE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5VJ2Q7RE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Litzow et al.","parsedDate":"2018-10-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Litzow, Erin, Kate J.

We examine the effects of company size and ownership on revenue sharing outcomes in North Dakota (ND), drawing on political economy bargaining models. We examine firm-level characteristics of ND’s oil producers from 2005 to 2015, matching these data against revenue sharing outcomes and estimating effects using graphical and statistical methods. Along with this core analysis, we conduct key informant interviews with four elite actors in the unconventional oil and gas sector in ND, to provide supplementary details on industry structure and voluntary contributions to local communities. Our findings suggest that when industry is dominated by larger, publicly-traded firms, there is more revenue sharing between firms and the state government. However, we find anecdotal evidence that smaller, local firms may better target resources towards local needs. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the varied outcomes at the sub-national and sub-state level and expands the “resource curse” literature that suggests that industry characteristics shape local outcomes.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"44","issue":"","pages":"371-384","date":"October 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2018.05.006","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Why does industry structure matter for unconventional oil and gas development?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618304651","accessDate":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bargaining models","type":1},{"tag":"Industry structure","type":1},{"tag":"Revenue sharing","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z","dateModified":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z","dateString":"October 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"TUN533EI","version":1533,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TUN533EI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TUN533EI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pierce et al.","parsedDate":"2018-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Pierce, Jonathan J., Hilary Boudet, Chad Zanocco, and Megan Hillyard. &#x201C;Analyzing the Factors That Influence U.S. Public Support for Exporting Natural Gas.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 120 (September 1, 2018): 666&#x2013;74. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.066.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"TUN533EI","version":1533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing the factors that influence U.S. public support for exporting natural gas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan J.","lastName":"Pierce"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Boudet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Zanocco"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Hillyard"}],"abstractNote":"The U.S. is now the global leader in natural gas production. The federal government is changing policies and priorities to expand natural gas export to foreign energy markets. Such an expansion requires increased pipeline capacity and the development of export terminals for shipping. While natural gas export is a burgeoning energy and environmental issue, we know little about what influences public support/opposition for the practice. Such information is vital to all levels of government and stakeholders. Using a national online survey sample (n = 1042), we examine what factors influence public support/opposition. Results of regression analysis indicate that supporters tend to be male, hold a bachelor's degree or higher, wealthier, politically conservative, and reference affective images of the economy, energy, and trade. In contrast, opponents tend to be women, politically liberal, and reference affective images related to keeping natural gas in the U.S., the environment, and hydraulic fracturing. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for energy policy, public communication about this issue, and future research.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"666-674","date":"September 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.066","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518303835","accessDate":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Risk communication","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z","dateModified":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z","dateString":"September 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"R5VFSS7R","version":1495,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R5VFSS7R","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R5VFSS7R","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gilbert and Sovacool","parsedDate":"2018-09","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gilbert, Alexander Q., and Benjamin K.

Using bounding scenarios of attributional lifecycle analysis, this study finds that the climate impacts of United States exports to China, Japan, India, or South Korea could vary significantly, with annual global lifecycle emissions ranging from −88,000 metric tons CO2e to + 170,000 metric tons CO2e per Bcf of exports. Exact emissions will depend on factors such as (a) the final end-use of the LNG, (b) domestic market impacts from increased natural gas prices in the United States, (c) induced additional energy consumption in importing countries, and (d) methane leakage rates. Country specific greenhouse gas outcomes can differ from global outcomes, with major implications for extraction and consumption based emissions accounting. The study's results indicate the need for more robust consideration of the climate impacts of all energy exports in terms of country specific energy analyses, global climate regulations, and market uncertainty. Thus, how gas is governed becomes of critical importance, for it will determine whether LNG is a net sink or source of additional emissions.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"635-643","date":"September 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Carbon pathways in the global gas market","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518303793","accessDate":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Attributional lifecycle analysis (ACLA)","type":1},{"tag":"Energy exports","type":1},{"tag":"LNG trade","type":1},{"tag":"Lifecycle analysis (LCA)","type":1},{"tag":"Liquefied natural gas (LNG)","type":1},{"tag":"Methane leakage","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z","dateModified":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z","dateString":"September 2018","dateValue":"2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"K4NZ5WXJ","version":1499,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/K4NZ5WXJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/K4NZ5WXJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Prest","parsedDate":"2018-08-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Prest, Brian C. &#x201C;Explanations for the 2014 Oil Price Decline: Supply or Demand?&#x201D; <i>Energy Economics</i> 74 (August 1, 2018): 63&#x2013;75. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2018.05.029.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"K4NZ5WXJ","version":1499,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Explanations for the 2014 oil price decline: Supply or demand?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brian C.","lastName":"Prest"}],"abstractNote":"The Brent price of crude oil declined from $112 in June 2014 to a low of $31 in January 2016 (both nominal prices), a cumulative decrease of more than 70%.

I find that the data are broadly inconsistent with this attribution of the decline to shale oil. Rather, the data are more consistent with a demand-side explanation of weakening global economic conditions and demand for commodities, including but not limited to oil. In summary, there is no evidence that the U.S. shale revolution played a significant role in the decline in oil prices since 2014. Rather, the evidence suggests that weakening oil demand played a much stronger role in driving the 2014 decline in oil prices.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"74","issue":"","pages":"63-75","date":"August 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.05.029","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Explanations for the 2014 oil price decline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318302020","accessDate":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Crude oil prices","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Shale oil","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z","dateString":"August 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"YCYQV8BZ","version":607,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YCYQV8BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YCYQV8BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Munasib and Rickman","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Munasib, Abdul, and Dan S.

Exploration, drilling and extraction are associated with direct increases in employment and income in the energy industry, but little is known about the impacts on other parts of local economies. Increased energy sector employment and income can have positive spillover effects through increased purchases of intermediate goods and induced local spending. Negative spillover effects can occur through rising local factor and goods prices and adverse effects on the local area quality of life. Therefore, this paper examines the net economic impacts of oil and gas production from shale formations for key shale oil and gas producing areas in Arkansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is used to establish a baseline projection for the local economies in the absence of increased energy development, allowing for estimation of the net regional economic effects of increased shale oil and gas production.","publicationTitle":"Regional Science and Urban Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"forthcoming","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2014.10.006","ISSN":"0166-0462","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts"},{"tag":"Shale oil and gas"},{"tag":"Synthetic control method"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:12Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:12Z","dateString":"forthcoming","dateValue":"2018-07-16T16:03:35.409Z"}},{"key":"RNKRCX39","version":1448,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RNKRCX39","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RNKRCX39","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kaufmann and Hines","parsedDate":"2018-07-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kaufmann, Robert K., and Edward Hines. &#x201C;The Effects of Combined-Cycle Generation and Hydraulic Fracturing on the Price for Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas: Implications for Carbon Taxes.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 118 (July 1, 2018): 603&#x2013;11. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.039.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"RNKRCX39","version":1448,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The effects of combined-cycle generation and hydraulic fracturing on the price for coal, oil, and natural gas: Implications for carbon taxes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert K.","lastName":"Kaufmann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Hines"}],"abstractNote":"We identify how the increased efficiency of generating electricity using gas-fired combined-cycle technology and the increased production of natural gas due to hydraulic fracturing in the US affect the first purchase price for coal, oil, and natural gas and their prices at electricity generating plants by estimating a cointegrating vector autoregression model from monthly observations between January 1991 and February 2016. Simulation experiments indicate that combined-cycle generation raises the long-run price of natural gas, both at the wellhead and electricity generating plants. Conversely, the increased production of natural gas has a relatively small long-run effect on natural gas prices. Historical counterfactuals indicate increased natural gas production since June 2003 lowers natural gas prices by an average of $0.16 per million BTU while combined cycle generation increases prices by an average of $0.54 per million BTU since April 1999. This increase is captured by natural gas producers such that the margin between prices at electricity generating plants and the wellhead shrinks by about $0.05 per million BTU.

When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 Tg/y, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. EPA inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO2 from natural gas combustion. Significant emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"eaar7204","date":"2018/06/21","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aar7204","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/06/20/science.aar7204","accessDate":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2018, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 29930092","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z","dateModified":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z","dateString":"June 21, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-21T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KX2CNYPF","version":1515,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KX2CNYPF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KX2CNYPF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kassotis et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-21","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kassotis, Christopher D., Susan C.

This wastewater is typically disposed of via injecting into disposal wells for long-term storage, treatment and discharge from wastewater treatment plants, and/or storage in open evaporation pits; however, wastewater spill rates are reported at 2–20% of active well sites across regions, increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of these wastewaters. This study assessed adipogenic activity (both triglyceride accumulation and pre-adipocyte proliferation) for a mixture of 23 commonly used UOG chemicals and a small subset of UOG wastewater-impacted surface water extracts from Colorado and West Virginia, using 3T3-L1 cells and a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) reporter assay. We report potent and efficacious adipogenic activity induced by both a laboratory-created UOG chemical mixture and UOG-impacted water samples at concentrations below environmental levels. We further report activation of PPARγ at similar concentrations for some samples, suggesting a causative molecular pathway for the observed effects, but not for other adipogenic samples, implicating PPARγ-dependent and independent effects from UOG associated chemicals. Taken together, these results suggest that UOG wastewater has the potential to impact metabolic health at environmentally relevant concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"June 21, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.030","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718316620","accessDate":"2018-06-21T13:27:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Adipogenesis","type":1},{"tag":"Endocrine disrupting chemicals","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Metabolic disruption","type":1},{"tag":"Obesity","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-21T13:27:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-21T13:27:34Z","dateString":"June 21, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-21T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"MP5FDKHP","version":1512,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MP5FDKHP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MP5FDKHP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barth-Naftilan et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-13","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Barth-Naftilan, E., J.

These concerns motivated our 2-year prospective study of groundwater quality within the Marcellus Shale. We installed eight multilevel monitoring wells within bedrock aquifers of a 25-km2 area targeted for shale gas development (SGD). Twenty-four isolated intervals within these wells were sampled monthly over 2 years and groundwater pressures were recorded before, during, and after seven shale gas wells were drilled, hydraulically fractured, and placed into production. Perturbations in groundwater pressures were detected at hilltop monitoring wells during drilling of nearby gas wells and during a gas well casing breach. In both instances, pressure changes were ephemeral (<24 hours) and no lasting impact on groundwater quality was observed. Overall, methane concentrations ([CH4]) ranged from detection limit to 70 mg/L, increased with aquifer depth, and, at several sites, exhibited considerable temporal variability. Methane concentrations in valley monitoring wells located above gas well laterals increased in conjunction with SGD, but CH4 isotopic composition and hydrocarbon composition (CH4/C2H6) are inconsistent with Marcellus origins for this gas. Further, salinity increased concurrently with [CH4], which rules out contamination by gas phase migration of fugitive methane from structurally compromised gas wells. Collectively, our observations suggest that SGD was an unlikely source of methane in our valley wells, and that naturally occurring methane in valley settings, where regional flow systems interact with local flow systems, is more variable in concentration and composition both temporally and spatially than previously understood.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"201720898","date":"2018/06/13","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1720898115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/12/1720898115","accessDate":"2018-06-20T14:05:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Harmonized policy scenarios (including mass-based emissions limits and various power-sector-only carbon tax trajectories) across 16 models provide comparative assessments of potential impacts on electric sector investment and generation outcomes, emissions reductions, and economic implications. This paper compares results across these policy alternatives, including a variety of technological and natural gas price assumptions, and summarizes robust findings and areas of disagreement across participating models. Under a wide range of policy, technology, and market assumptions, model results suggest that future coal generation will decline relative to current levels while generation from natural gas, wind, and solar will increase, though the pace and extent of these changes vary by policy scenario, technological assumptions, region, and model. Climate policies can amplify trends already under way and make them less susceptible to future market changes. The model results provide useful insights to a range of stakeholders, but future research focused on intersectoral linkages in emission reductions (e.g., the role of electrification), effects of energy storage, and better coverage of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can improve insights even further.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"307-325","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.04.012","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Electric sector policy, technological change, and U.S. emissions reductions goals","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301373","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"Electric sector","type":1},{"tag":"Energy-economic modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Market-based environmental policy","type":1},{"tag":"Model intercomparison","type":1},{"tag":"Technology","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z","dateString":"June 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"YXBHVF35","version":1502,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YXBHVF35","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YXBHVF35","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Creason et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Creason, Jared R., John E.

This paper focuses on the effects of technology and market assumptions with projections out to 2050. A total of 15 models contributed projections based on a set of standardized scenarios. The scenarios include a range of assumptions about the price of natural gas, costs of end-use energy efficiency, retirements of nuclear power, the cost of renewable electricity, and overall electricity demand. The range of models and scenarios represent similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of analytical methods. One similarity across almost all results from all models and scenarios is that the share of electricity generation and capacity fueled by coal shrinks over time, although the rate at which coal capacity is retired depends on the price of natural gas and the amount of electricity that is demanded. Another similarity is that the models project average increases in natural gas power generating capacity in every scenario over the 2020–2050 period, but at lower average annual rates than those that prevailed during the 2000–2015 period. The projections also include higher gas capacity utilization rates in the 2035–2050 period compared to the 2020–2050 period in every scenario, except the high gas price sensitivity. Renewables capacity is also projected to increase in every scenario, although the annual new capacity varies from modest rates below the observed 2000–2015 wind and solar average to rates more than 3 times that high. Model estimates of CO2 emissions largely follow from the trends in generation. Low renewables cost and low gas prices both result in lower overall CO2 emission rates relative to the 2020–2035 and 2035–2050 reference. Both limited nuclear lifetimes and higher demand result in increased CO2 emissions.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"290-306","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.04.013","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Effects of technology assumptions on US power sector capacity, generation and emissions projections","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301385","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Electric sector","type":1},{"tag":"Energy-economic modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Model intercomparison","type":1},{"tag":"Technology","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z","dateString":"June 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"SLZE6DMP","version":1511,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SLZE6DMP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SLZE6DMP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hoy and Wrenn","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hoy, Kyle A., and Douglas H.

In this paper, we combine results from a structural demand model with a two-sector trade model to analyze the interstate welfare impacts of Pennsylvania's current severance tax proposal. Our results demonstrate that most of the welfare losses from this proposed policy are likely to be shifted to residents in other states. We also demonstrate how fluctuations in gas prices can substantially reduce tax revenue. These findings have important implications for both Pennsylvania and U.S. energy policy given the significant rise in energy production from new sources throughout the U.S.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"53-65","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.05.002","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Unconventional energy, taxation, and interstate welfare","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301695","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy demand","type":1},{"tag":"Tax shifting","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional energy","type":1},{"tag":"Welfare","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z","dateString":"June 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6NF96XWW","version":1451,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6NF96XWW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6NF96XWW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Botner et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Botner, E.

Previous studies have shown that natural gas methane (CH4) is present in groundwater near shale gas wells in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania, but did not have pre-drilling baseline measurements. Here, we present the results of a free public water testing program in the Utica Shale of Ohio, where we measured CH4 concentration, CH4 stable isotopic composition, and pH and conductivity along temporal and spatial gradients of hydraulic fracturing activity. Dissolved CH4 ranged from 0.2 μg/L to 25 mg/L, and stable isotopic measurements indicated a predominantly biogenic carbonate reduction CH4 source. Radiocarbon dating of CH4 in combination with stable isotopic analysis of CH4 in three samples indicated that fossil C substrates are the source of CH4 in groundwater, with one 14C date indicative of modern biogenic carbonate reduction. We found no relationship between CH4 concentration or source in groundwater and proximity to active gas well sites. No significant changes in CH4 concentration, CH4 isotopic composition, pH, or conductivity in water wells were observed during the study period. These data indicate that high levels of biogenic CH4 can be present in groundwater wells independent of hydraulic fracturing activity and affirm the need for isotopic or other fingerprinting techniques for CH4 source identification. Continued monitoring of private drinking water wells is critical to ensure that groundwater quality is not altered as hydraulic fracturing activity continues in the region.

Through interviews with roughly 250 local officials, we evaluate the fiscal effects of this development in 21 regions across every major US oil and gas producing state during “boom” and “bust” periods. Growing oil and gas production has increased local government revenues through a variety of mechanisms, including property taxes, sales taxes, severance taxes, and more. Industry activity has also increased costs and demand for local services led by road damage, water and wastewater infrastructure, and a range of staff costs including emergency services and law enforcement. Despite volatility in revenues and service demands, our interview results show that 74% of local governments have experienced net fiscal benefits, 14% reported roughly neutral effects, and 12% reported net fiscal costs. Local governments in highly rural regions experiencing large-scale growth have faced the greatest challenges. To further improve future outcomes, local officials can plan for impacts, state policymakers can re-examine revenue policies, and operators can pursue collaboration with local governments.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"117","issue":"","pages":"14-24","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.042","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518301198","accessDate":"2018-07-09T13:03:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:03:26Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:03:26Z","dateString":"June 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"CQFX3QYQ","version":1530,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CQFX3QYQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CQFX3QYQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Casey et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Casey, Joan A., Sidra Goldman-Mellor, and Ralph Catalano. &#x201C;Association between Oklahoma Earthquakes and Anxiety-Related Google Search Episodes.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Epidemiology</i> 2, no. 2 (June 2018): e016. https://doi.org/10.1097/EE9.0000000000000016.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"CQFX3QYQ","version":1530,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association between Oklahoma earthquakes and anxiety-related Google search episodes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joan A.","lastName":"Casey"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sidra","lastName":"Goldman-Mellor"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Catalano"}],"abstractNote":"Background: Oklahoma has experienced a rise in seismicity since 2010, with many earthquakes induced by wastewater injection. While large single earthquakes have documented mental health repercussions, health implications of these new, frequent earthquakes remain unknown. We aimed to examine associations between Oklahoma earthquakes and statewide anxiety measured by Google queries.\n        Methods: The U.S. Geologic Survey’s Advanced National Seismic System Comprehensive Catalog supplied earthquake dates and magnitudes. We used the Google Health application programming interface to compile the proportion of weekly Oklahoma-based health-related search episodes for anxiety. A quasi-experimental time-series analysis from January 2010 to May 2017 evaluated monthly counts of earthquakes ≥ magnitude 4 (a level felt by most people) in relation to anxiety, controlling for US-wide anxiety search episodes and Oklahoma-specific health-related queries.\n        Results: Oklahoma experienced an average of two (SD = 2) earthquakes ≥ magnitude 4 per month during the study period. For each additional earthquake ≥ magnitude 4, the proportion of Google search episodes for anxiety increased by 1.3% (95% confidence interval = 0.1%, 2.4%); 60% of this increase persisted for the following month. In months with 2 or more ≥ magnitude 4 earthquakes, the proportion of Google search episodes focused on anxiety increased by 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 2.3%, 9.3%). In a sub-analysis, Google search episodes for anxiety peaked about 3 weeks after ≥ magnitude 4 quakes.\n        Conclusions: These findings suggest that the recent increase in Oklahoma earthquakes has elicited a psychological response that may have implications for public health and regulatory policy.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Epidemiology","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"e016","date":"June 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en-US","DOI":"10.1097/EE9.0000000000000016","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2018/06000/Association_between_Oklahoma_earthquakes_and.8.aspx","accessDate":"2018-07-02T12:47:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.lww.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC","FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-02T12:47:02Z","dateModified":"2018-07-02T12:47:02Z","dateString":"June 2018","dateValue":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KCX6PAY2","version":1478,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KCX6PAY2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KCX6PAY2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Tasker et al.","parsedDate":"2018-05-30","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Tasker, T.

In this study, the potential environmental and human health impacts of this practice are evaluated. Analyses of O&G wastewaters spread on roads in the northeastern, U.S. show that these wastewaters have salt, radioactivity, and organic contaminant concentrations often many times above drinking water standards. Bioassays also indicated that these wastewaters contain organic micropollutants that affected signaling pathways consistent with xenobiotic metabolism and caused toxicity to aquatic organisms like Daphnia magna. The potential toxicity of these wastewaters is a concern as lab experiments demonstrated that nearly all of the metals from these wastewaters leach from roads after rain events, likely reaching ground and surface water. Release of a known carcinogen (e.g., radium) from roads treated with O&G wastewaters has been largely ignored. In Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2014, spreading O&G wastewater on roads released over 4 times more radium to the environment (320 millicuries) than O&G wastewater treatment facilities and 200 times more radium than spill events. Currently, state-by-state regulations do not require radium analyses prior to treating roads with O&G wastewaters. Methods for reducing the potential impacts of spreading O&G wastewaters on roads are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 30, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In response to these calls, we have compiled a spatially-resolved inventory of changes in water consumption associated with the coal-to-gas transition in Pennsylvania at the resolution of watersheds from 2009 to 2012. Results indicate that the total water consumption of the fuel extraction and power sectors in Pennsylvania increased by 7.6 million m3 (2 Bgal) over four years. At the state and watershed scales, we compare total water consumption for the coal-to-gas transition to a case where only the water consumed across two life cycle stages of electricity generation is considered – fuel extraction and use at the power plant to generate electricity. The results for the latter indicate that water consumption decreased by over 15.1 million m3 (4 Bgal). For both cases, watershed-level results showed water consumption generally increased in watersheds with growing shale gas activity or new natural gas capacity, while it decreased with diminishing coal-fired generation. Watershed-scale water consumption from 2009 to 2012 may be reversed from a net increase to decrease (and vice versa) when the total water consumption is compared to the water consumed specifically for life cycle stages of electricity generation, reinforcing the importance of further developing spatially-resolved inventories for LCA. Focusing on the water consumption associated with only electricity generation and its fuel use does not capture the full effects of fuel extracted for use in other sectors. We suggest that spatially-explicit inventories that include multiple life cycle stages should be a critical component in the development of more comprehensive, spatial LCA methodology. Spatial differentiation in inventories is necessary to adequately characterize watershed-level impacts that can be normalized over a functional unit. The approach can be used as a complementary assessment to LCA that can inform policy-makers and investors about where energy developments may pose additional risks to water supply and availability.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cleaner Production","volume":"184","issue":"","pages":"366-374","date":"May 20, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Cleaner Production","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.217","ISSN":"0959-6526","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261830547X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Coal mining","type":1},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment","type":1},{"tag":"Power generation","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Water use","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z","dateString":"May 20, 2018","dateValue":"2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"F5DDFKRF","version":1445,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/F5DDFKRF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/F5DDFKRF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Grubert and Sanders","parsedDate":"2018-05-08","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Grubert, Emily, and Kelly T.

To support resource comanagement and fill this noted gap in the literature, this work presents detailed estimates for US-based water consumption and withdrawals for the US energy system as of 2014, including both intensity values and the first known estimate of total water consumption and withdrawal by the US energy system. We address 126 unit processes, many of which are new additions to the literature, differentiated among 17 fuel cycles, five life cycle stages, three water source categories, and four levels of water quality. Overall coverage is about 99% of commercially traded US primary energy consumption with detailed energy flows by unit process. Energy-related water consumption, or water removed from its source and not directly returned, accounts for about 10% of both total and freshwater US water consumption. Major consumers include biofuels (via irrigation), oil (via deep well injection, usually of nonfreshwater), and hydropower (via evaporation and seepage). The US energy system also accounts for about 40% of both total and freshwater US water withdrawals, i.e., water removed from its source regardless of fate.

However, not all regions experience the same degree of coal-to-gas generation switching or electricity price declines. Specifically, regions experiencing more coal-to-gas switching experience smaller electricity price drops. We provide intuition that may explain this pattern. This finding also has environmental and welfare consequences: coal-fired plants emit more pollutants, and therefore regions that benefit more from greater emissions reductions experience lower benefits from declining electricity prices. The finding highlights a mechanism through which a carbon price would have heterogeneous impacts across regions.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","volume":"89","issue":"","pages":"1-28","date":"May 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jeem.2018.02.002","ISSN":"0095-0696","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069616303904","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:57:00Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Coal","type":1},{"tag":"Cost pass-through","type":1},{"tag":"Electricity prices","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Pollution","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:57:00Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:57:00Z","dateString":"May 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"JACQDHN6","version":519,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JACQDHN6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JACQDHN6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McKenzie et al.","parsedDate":"2018-04-09","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McKenzie, Lisa M., Benjamin Blair, John Hughes, William B.

Hydraulic fracturing, a common form of stimulation, involves the high-pressure injection of water, chemicals, and sand to fracture the target layer and release trapped natural gas and/or oil. Spills and/or discharges of wastewater have been shown to impact surface, ground, and drinking water. The goals of this study were to characterize the endocrine activities and measure select organic contaminants in groundwater from conventional oil and gas (COG) and UOG production regions of Wyoming. Groundwater samples were collected from each region, solid-phase extracted, and assessed for endocrine activities (estrogen, androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and thyroid receptor agonism and antagonism), using reporter gene assays in human endometrial cells. Water samples from UOG and conventional oil areas exhibited greater ER antagonist activities than water samples from conventional gas areas. Samples from UOG areas tended to exhibit progesterone receptor antagonism more often, suggesting there may be a UOG-related impact on these endocrine activities. We also report UOG-specific contaminants in Pavillion groundwater extracts, and these same chemicals at high concentrations in a local UOG wastewater sample. A unique suite of contaminants was observed in groundwater from a permitted drinking water well at a COG well pad and not at any UOG sites; high levels of endocrine activities (most notably, maximal estrogenic activity) were noted there, suggesting putative impacts on endocrine bioactivities by COG. As such, we report two levels of evidence for groundwater contamination by both UOG and COG operations in Wyoming.","publicationTitle":"Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"1-12","date":"2018/04/05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Arch Environ Contam Toxicol","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s00244-018-0521-2","ISSN":"0090-4341, 1432-0703","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-018-0521-2","accessDate":"2018-05-01T12:58:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T12:58:20Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T12:58:33Z","dateString":"April 5, 2018","dateValue":"2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"MHFZHMWY","version":739,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MHFZHMWY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MHFZHMWY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","parsedDate":"2018-04","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. &#x201C;Explanation and Summary of Preliminary Mechanical Integrity Assessment Dataset.&#x201D; Harrisburg, PA: Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, April 2018.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"MHFZHMWY","version":739,"itemType":"report","title":"Explanation and Summary of Preliminary Mechanical Integrity Assessment Dataset","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"8100-RE-DEP4716","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Harrisburg, PA","institution":"Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management","date":"April 2018","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-16T19:06:17Z","dateModified":"2018-04-16T19:07:27Z","dateString":"April 2018","dateValue":"2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"RK6DZUWA","version":534,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RK6DZUWA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RK6DZUWA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bean et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-29","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bean, Jeffrey Kevin, Sahil Bhandari, Anthony Bilotto, and Lea Hildebrandt Ruiz. &#x201C;Formation of Particulate Matter from the Oxidation of Evaporated Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>, March 29, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b06009.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"RK6DZUWA","version":534,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Formation of Particulate Matter from the Oxidation of Evaporated Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeffrey Kevin","lastName":"Bean"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sahil","lastName":"Bhandari"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Bilotto"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lea","lastName":"Hildebrandt Ruiz"}],"abstractNote":"The use of hydraulic fracturing for production of petroleum and natural gas has increased dramatically in the last decade, but the environmental impacts of this technology remain unclear. Experiments were conducted to quantify airborne emissions from twelve samples of hydraulic fracturing flowback wastewater collected in the Permian Basin, as well as the photochemical processing of these emissions leading to the formation of particulate matter. The concentration of total volatile carbon (TVC, hydrocarbons evaporating at room temperature) averaged 29 mg of carbon (C) L-1. After photochemical oxidation under high NOx conditions the amount of organic particulate matter (PM) formed per milliliter of wastewater evaporated averaged 24 µg; the amount of ammonium nitrate formed averaged 262 µg. Based on the mean PM formation observed in these experiments, the estimated formation of PM from evaporated flowback wastewater in the state of Texas is in the range of estimated PM emissions from diesel engines used in oil rigs. Evaporation of flowback wastewater, a hitherto unrecognized source of secondary pollutants, could significantly contribute to ambient PM concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 29, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"13","issue":"3","pages":"e0194203","date":"Mar 23, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","accessDate":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.plos.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T13:53:34Z","dateString":"March 23, 2018","dateValue":"2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"TAGT9H37","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TAGT9H37","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TAGT9H37","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zavala-Araiza et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-22","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zavala-Araiza, Daniel, Scott C.

In the region that is densely populated with oil producing facilities, many localized geohazards, such as ground subsidence and micro-earthquakes, have gone unnoticed. Here we identify the localized geohazards in West Texas, using the satellite radar interferometry from newly launched radar satellites that provide radar images freely to public for the first time, and probe the causal mechanisms of ground deformation, encompassing oil/gas production activities and subsurface geological characteristics. Based on our observations and analyses, human activities of fluid (saltwater, CO2) injection for stimulation of hydrocarbon production, salt dissolution in abandoned oil facilities, and hydrocarbon extraction each have negative impacts on the ground surface and infrastructures, including possible induced seismicity. Proactive continuous and detailed monitoring of ground deformation from space over the currently operating and the previously operated oil/gas production facilities, as demonstrated by this research, is essential to securing the safety of humanity, preserving property, and sustaining the growth of the hydrocarbon production industry.","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"4727","date":"2018-03-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-23143-6","ISSN":"2045-2322","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23143-6","accessDate":"2018-03-23T12:58:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s)","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/1352990/items/5EADYE2R"},"dateAdded":"2018-03-23T12:59:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-23T12:59:06Z","dateString":"March 16, 2018","dateValue":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"D62T9MXF","version":214,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/D62T9MXF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/D62T9MXF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cheung et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cheung, Ron, Daniel Wetherell, and Stephan Whitaker. &#x201C;Induced Earthquakes and Housing Markets: Evidence from Oklahoma.&#x201D; <i>Regional Science and Urban Economics</i> 69 (March 1, 2018): 153&#x2013;66. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2018.01.004.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"D62T9MXF","version":214,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Induced earthquakes and housing markets: Evidence from Oklahoma","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Cheung"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Wetherell"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Whitaker"}],"abstractNote":"This paper examines the impact of earthquakes on residential property values using sales data from Oklahoma from 2006 to 2014.

By some estimates, global consumption and production of fossil fuels—particularly coal and oil—will need to end almost entirely within 50 years. Given the scale of such a transition, nations may need to consider policies that constrain growth in fossil fuel supplies in addition to those that reduce demand. Here, we examine the emissions implications of a supply-constraining measure that was rapidly gaining momentum in the United States (US) under the Obama administration: ceasing the issuance of new leases for fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters. Such a measure could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 280 million tons annually by 2030, comparable to that of other major climate policies adopted or considered by the Obama administration. Our findings suggest that measures to constrain fossil fuel supply—though not currently viable in a US Trump administration—deserve further consideration at subnational levels in the US or by other countries now, and by future US administrations.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"1-14","date":"2018/02/22","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-018-2152-z","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"Would constraining US fossil fuel production affect global CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions?","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-018-2152-z","accessDate":"2018-04-16T20:44:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-16T20:44:45Z","dateModified":"2018-04-16T20:44:45Z","dateString":"February 22, 2018","dateValue":"2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"YM4Z79DB","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Snee and Zoback","parsedDate":"2018-02-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Snee, Jens-Erik Lund, and Mark D.

In recent years, seismicity has been concentrated near Pecos, Texas; around the Dagger Draw Field, New Mexico; and near the Cogdell Field, Snyder, Texas. We have collected hundreds of measurements of stress orientation and relative magnitude to identify potentially active normal, normal/strike-slip, or strike-slip faults that might be susceptible to earthquake triggering in this region. In the Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform, the faulting regime is consistently normal/strike slip, and the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) is approximately east–west, although modest rotations of the SHmax direction are seen in some areas. Within the Delaware Basin, however, a large-magnitude clockwise rotation (∼150°) of SHmax occurs progressively from being nearly north–south in the north to east-southeast–west-northwest...","publicationTitle":"The Leading Edge","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2018-02-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1190/tle37020127.1","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"State of stress in the Permian Basin, Texas and New Mexico","url":"https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle37020127.1","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:57:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"world","libraryCatalog":"library.seg.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"February 2, 2018","dateValue":"2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7EHSXI5C","version":121,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goh and Ang","parsedDate":"2018-02-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goh, Tian, and B.

There is no standard approach to tackle this problem. The most common approach, which is known as the primary energy equivalent (PEE) approach, estimates emission reductions by computing the amount of CO2 emissions that would have been emitted from fossil fuels had renewables or nuclear energy not been used. Another approach, the Equal Share (ES) approach, estimates emission reductions based on the change in the share of non-fossil based energy. As the two approaches have some limitations, a more comprehensive approach based on index decomposition analysis (IDA) is proposed as an alternative, together with an extension to quantify substitution amongst non-fossil based sources. A comparison of the assumptions and features of all three approaches is presented. The study finds that IDA is favoured for its ability to identify policy intervention areas beyond a switch to cleaner energy and is well-suited for tracking of progress towards emission reduction targets and analysing future scenarios.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"651-662","date":"February 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.019","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517307656","accessDate":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Decarbonisation","type":1},{"tag":"Emission reductions","type":1},{"tag":"Index decomposition analysis","type":1},{"tag":"LMDI","type":1},{"tag":"Paasche index","type":1},{"tag":"Renewable energy","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateString":"February 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GS5Z8M5J","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ravikumar et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ravikumar, Arvind P., Jingfan Wang, Mike McGuire, Clay S.

A key feature of recent methane mitigation policies is the use of periodic leak detection surveys, typically done with optical gas imaging (OGI) technologies. The most common OGI technology is an infrared camera. In this work, we experimentally develop detection probability curves for OGI-based methane leak detection under different environmental and imaging conditions. Controlled single blind leak detection tests show that the median detection limit (50% detection likelihood) for FLIR-camera based OGI technology is about 20 g CH4/h at an imaging distance of 6 m, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported estimates of 1.4 g CH4/h. Furthermore, we show that median and 90% detection likelihood limit follows a power-law relationship with imaging distance. Finally, we demonstrate that real-world marginal effectiveness of methane mitigation through periodic surveys approaches zero as leak detection sensitivity improves. For example, a median detection limit of 100 g CH4/h is sufficient to detect the maximum amount of leakage that is possible through periodic surveys. Policy makers should take note of these limits while designing equivalence metrics for next-generation leak detection technologies that can trade sensitivity for cost without affecting mitigation priorities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 19, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

While this practice was largely discontinued in 2011 for unconventional Marcellus OGW, it continues for conventional OGW. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental implications of the policy allowing the disposal of conventional OGW. We collected stream sediments from three discharge sites receiving treated OGW between 2014-2017 and measured 228Ra, 226Ra, and their decay products, 228Th and 210Pb, respectively. We consistently found elevated activities of 228Ra and 226Ra in stream sediments in the vicinity of the outfall (total Ra = 90-25,000 Bq/kg) compared to upstream sediments (20-80 Bq/kg). In 2015 and 2017, 228Th/228Ra activity ratios in sediments from two disposal sites were relatively low (0.2-0.7), indicating that a portion of the Ra has accumulated in the sediments in recent (<3) years, when no unconventional Marcellus OGW was reportedly discharged. 228Ra/226Ra activity ratios were also higher than what would be expected solely from disposal of low 228Ra/226Ra Marcellus OGW. Based on these variations, we concluded that recent disposal of treated conventional OGW is the source of high Ra in stream sediments at CWT facility disposal sites. Consequently, policies pertaining to the disposal of only unconventional fluids are not adequate in preventing radioactive contamination in sediments at disposal sites, and the permission to release of treated Ra-rich conventional OGW through CWT facilities should be reconsidered.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 4, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In this paper, we quantify four leading sources: (1) state taxes levied on the value or volume of oil and gas produced; (2) local property taxes levied on the value of oil and gas property; (3) oil and gas lease revenues from state lands; and (4) oil and gas lease revenues from federal lands. We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas-producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10% of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1% to a high of nearly 40% (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments’ current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"112","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"12-18","date":"January 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.002","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517306250","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:32:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Resource taxation","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"BC9SCUSZ","version":186,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BC9SCUSZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BC9SCUSZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Caron-Beaudoin et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Caron-Beaudoin, &#xC9;lyse, Naomi Valter, Jonathan Chevrier, Pierre Ayotte, Katherine Frohlich, and Marc-Andr&#xE9; Verner. &#x201C;Gestational Exposure to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada: A Pilot Study.&#x201D; <i>Environment International</i> 110 (January 2018): 131&#x2013;38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"BC9SCUSZ","version":186,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada: A pilot study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Élyse","lastName":"Caron-Beaudoin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi","lastName":"Valter"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Chevrier"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Ayotte"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Frohlich"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marc-André","lastName":"Verner"}],"abstractNote":"Background\nNortheastern British Columbia (Canada) is an area of intense hydraulic fracturing for unconventional natural gas exploitation. There have been multiple reports of air and water contamination by volatile organic compounds in the vicinity of gas wells. Although these chemicals are known developmental toxicants, no biomonitoring effort has been carried out in the region.\nObjective\nTo evaluate gestational exposure to benzene and toluene in the Peace River Valley, Northeastern British Columbia (Canada).\nMethods\nUrine samples were collected over five consecutive days from 29 pregnant women. Metabolites of benzene (s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA)) and toluene (s-benzylmercapturic acid (S-BMA)) were measured in pooled urine samples from each participant. Levels of benzene metabolites were compared to those from the general Canadian population and from a biomonitoring study of residents from an area of active gas exploitation in Pavillion, Wyoming (USA). Levels measured in participants from the two recruitment sites, and self-identifying as Indigenous or non-Indigenous, were also compared.\nResults\nWhereas the median S-PMA level (0.18 μg/g creatinine) in our study was similar to that in the general Canadian population, the median t,t-MA level (180 μg/g creatinine) was approximately 3.5 times higher. Five women had t,t-MA levels above the biological exposure index® proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The median urinary S-BMA level in our pilot study was 7.00 μg/g creatinine. Urinary metabolite levels were slightly higher in self-identifying Indigenous women, but this difference was only statistically significant for S-PMA.\nDiscussion\nUrinary t,t-MA levels, but not S-PMA levels, measured in our study are suggestive of a higher benzene exposure in participating pregnant women from the Peace River Valley than in the general Canadian population. Given the small sample size and limitations of t,t-MA measurements (e.g., non-specificity), more extensive monitoring is warranted.","publicationTitle":"Environment International","volume":"110","issue":"","pages":"131-138","date":"January 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environment International","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022","ISSN":"0160-4120","shortTitle":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017310309","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:05:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 2018","dateValue":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"EF4RVSX3","version":1441,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EF4RVSX3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EF4RVSX3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Petersen et al.","parsedDate":"2018","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Petersen, Mark D., Charles S.

This growth and subsequent contraction has affected local governments in dozens of regions. From 2013 to 2015, we conducted structured interviews with hundreds of local officials in 21 regions across 16 states, finding that most local governments had experienced net fiscal benefits from increased oil and gas development. We returned to five key regions (the Bakken, Denver-Julesburg, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, and Permian plays) in 2016 and 2017 to see whether and how the downturn had affected fiscal conditions for local governments. While effects varied depending on local factors, fiscal conditions have generally improved, with 82 percent of local governments reporting net positive fiscal effects, compared with 63 percent during our previous visits to these regions. However, managing revenue volatility has emerged as a major challenge for many local governments, and while economic diversification is a priority for most local officials, achieving this goal will be difficult, particularly for rural communities that are or have become heavily dependent on the oil and gas sector.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"December 20, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/local-fiscal-effects-drilling-downturn-local-government-impacts-decreased-oil","accessDate":"2018-07-09","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:51:50Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:51:50Z","dateString":"December 20, 2017","dateValue":"2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9GDUZ58L","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Worden et al.","parsedDate":"2017-12-20","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Worden, John R., A.

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"12","pages":"e1603021","date":"2017/12/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1603021","ISSN":"2375-2548","shortTitle":"Hydraulic fracturing and infant health","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1603021","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:29:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"advances.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Three key pecuniary provisions were annual well fees, increased bonding requirements, and higher penalty limits for violations. We analyze the effects of these mandates on well operator behavior using data on well operations and inspections over the period 2000–2013. After deriving theoretical predictions, we empirically examine each provision’s effect on firm behavior in two aspects: (i) acquisition of new well permits, and (ii) regulatory violations. Overall, we find the amendments induced firms to acquire fewer permits and elevate environmental protection effort.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"50","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"15-35","date":"November 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Resource and Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.reseneeco.2017.06.002","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"Taming drillers through legislative action","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765516301609","accessDate":"2017-10-30T14:19:27Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental bonds","type":1},{"tag":"General deterrence","type":1},{"tag":"Impact fee","type":1},{"tag":"Regulatory compliance","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"November 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KA9DNCQ7","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KA9DNCQ7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KA9DNCQ7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Magnani et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Magnani, Maria Beatrice, Michael L.

Since 2009, earthquake activity in the CUS has increased markedly, and numerous publications suggest that this increase is primarily due to induced earthquakes caused by deep-well injection of wastewater, both flowback water from hydrofracturing operations and produced water accompanying hydrocarbon production. Alternatively, some argue that these earthquakes are natural and that the seismicity increase is a normal variation that occurs over millions of years. Our analysis shows that within the NME, faults deform both Quaternary alluvium and underlying sediments dating from Paleozoic through Tertiary, with displacement increasing with geologic unit age, documenting a long history of natural activity. In the FWB, a region of ongoing wastewater injection, basement faults show deformation of the Proterozoic and Paleozoic units, but little or no deformation of younger strata. Specifically, vertical displacements in the post-Pennsylvanian formations, if any, are below the resolution (~15 m) of the seismic data, far less than expected had these faults accumulated deformation over millions of years. Our results support the assertion that recent FWB earthquakes are of induced origin; this conclusion is entirely independent of analyses correlating seismicity and wastewater injection practices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to discriminate natural and induced seismicity using classical structural geology analysis techniques.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"11","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Adv","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1701593","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701593.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"November 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"47DJY6VU","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/47DJY6VU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/47DJY6VU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yoon et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yoon, Clara E., Yihe Huang, William L.

These top-down measurements were directly compared with region-specific bottom-up inventories that utilized current industry-reported flaring and venting volumes (reported data) and quantitative estimates of unreported venting and fugitive sources. For the 50 × 50 km measurement region near Red Deer, characterized by natural gas and light oil production, measured methane fluxes were more than 17 times greater than that derived from directly reported data but consistent with our region-specific bottom-up inventory-based estimate. For the 60 × 60 km measurement region near Lloydminster, characterized by significant cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS), airborne measured methane fluxes were five times greater than directly reported emissions from venting and flaring and four times greater than our region-specific bottom up inventory-based estimate. Extended across Alberta, our results suggest that reported venting emissions in Alberta should be 2.5 ± 0.5 times higher, and total methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector (excluding mined oil sands) are likely at least 25–50% greater than current government estimates. Successful mitigation efforts in the Red Deer region will need to focus on the >90% of methane emissions currently unmeasured or unreported.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 17, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Two different impact assessment methods estimate the HTI of shale gas electricity to be 1–2 orders of magnitude less than the HTI of coal electricity (0.016–0.024 DALY/GWh versus 0.69–1.7 DALY/GWh). Further, an implausible shale gas scenario where all fracturing fluid and untreated produced water is discharged directly to surface water throughout the lifetime of a well also has a lower HTI than coal electricity. Particulate matter dominates the HTI for both systems, representing a much larger contribution to the overall toxicity burden than VOCs or any aquatic emission. Aquatic emissions can become larger contributors to the HTI when waste products are inadequately disposed or there are significant infrastructure or equipment failures. Large uncertainty and lack of exposure data prevent a full risk assessment; however, the results of this analysis provide a comparison of relative toxicity, which can be used to identify target areas for improvement and assess potential trade-offs with other environmental impacts.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock methane emissions in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock methane emissions factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. <h3>Results</h3> Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;18.2&nbsp;Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11% greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8.4% increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36.7% increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management methane emissions for 2011 in the US increased by 71.8%. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock methane emissions, (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0.05&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.05 degree resolution. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our revised bottom-up estimates of global livestock methane emissions are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual methane emissions since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock methane emissions, while not the dominant overall source of global methane emissions, may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000s to 2010s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock methane emissions from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and bottom-up estimates of methane emissions, will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments.","publicationTitle":"Carbon Balance and Management","volume":"12","issue":"16","pages":"","date":"2017/09/29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:21:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"2017 The Author(s)","extra":"DOI: 10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:58:54Z","dateString":"September 29, 2017","dateValue":"2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"XVNFT26H","version":576,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XVNFT26H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XVNFT26H","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Herrnstadt and Sweeney","parsedDate":"2017-09-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Herrnstadt, Evan, and Richard L.

Health studies have relied on proximity to O&G wells as an exposure metric, typically using an inverse distance-weighting (IDW) approach. Because O&G emissions are dependent on multiple factors, a dynamic model is needed to describe the variability in air pollution emissions over space and time. We used information on Colorado O&G activities, production volumes, and air pollutant emission rates from two Colorado basins to create a spatiotemporal industrial activity model to develop an intensity-adjusted IDW well-count metric. The Spearman correlation coefficient between this metric and measured pollutant concentrations was 0.74. We applied our model to households in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the middle of the densely developed Denver–Julesburg basin. Our intensity-adjusted IDW increased the unadjusted IDW dynamic range by a factor of 19 and distinguishes high-intensity events, such as hydraulic fracturing and flowback, from lower-intensity events, such as production at single-well pads. As the frequency of multiwell pads increases, it will become increasingly important to characterize the range of intensities at O&G sites when conducting epidemiological studies.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"17","pages":"10243-10250","date":"September 5, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Rapid industry expansion has also had significant and widespread impacts at the community level. This study provides an in-depth look at pre-K–12 educational impacts across six oil- and gas-producing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Colorado—to understand the benefits and challenges of the recent resource booms on student enrollment, teachers, public education finances, and student achievement metrics. Understanding the effects of such booms on public education is significant in the short and long term, notably because of their potential influence on educational achievement, career-based decisionmaking, and subsequently, the economic health of a community. A mixed-methods design, coupling difference-in-difference statistical analysis with extensive interviews, reveals a series of key insights across and within states. Broadly, we find divergent trends in student enrollment, student-teacher ratios, and per pupil revenue and expenses between school districts in the eastern versus western United States. In contrast to much of the existing literature, interviews across all regions reported minimal concern with increased dropout rates. Stress from financial uncertainty was also acute and common across all boom districts. Taken together, this analysis underscores the importance of the mixed-methods approach and cautions against overgeneralization of effects across disparate boom regions.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"August 10, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-booms-public-education-mixed-methods","accessDate":"2017-10-27","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 10, 2017","dateValue":"2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"2CYKEU8G","version":579,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2CYKEU8G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2CYKEU8G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hoy et al.","parsedDate":"2017-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hoy, Kyle A., Timothy W.

In this study, we use detailed county records and results from a survey to directly address these assumptions, and compare our results to the findings in an economic impact study of Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania which Kinnaman critiqued. Our results, which are only about 52% of the prior study, confirm his supposition that some ex ante studies use unrealistic assumptions which lead to gross overestimates of the impacts.","publicationTitle":"Ecological Economics","volume":"138","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"178-185","date":"August 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.03.037","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915306704","accessDate":"2017-11-14T18:27:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Input-output models","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GPENUQ8M","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GPENUQ8M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GPENUQ8M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Wang, Chi-Yuen, Michael Manga, Manoochehr Shirzaei, Matthew Weingarten, and Lee-Ping Wang. &#x201C;Induced Seismicity in Oklahoma Affects Shallow Groundwater.&#x201D; <i>Seismological Research Letters</i> 88, no. 4 (July 1, 2017): 956&#x2013;62. https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170017.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GPENUQ8M","version":196,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Induced Seismicity in Oklahoma Affects Shallow Groundwater","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chi-Yuen","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Manga"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Manoochehr","lastName":"Shirzaei"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Weingarten"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lee-Ping","lastName":"Wang"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Seismological Research Letters","volume":"88","issue":"4","pages":"956-962","date":"2017/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Seismological Research Letters","language":"en","DOI":"10.1785/0220170017","ISSN":"0895-0695","shortTitle":"","url":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article/88/4/956/354128/induced-seismicity-in-oklahoma-affects-shallow","accessDate":"2018-02-12T16:14:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.geoscienceworld.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"July 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9U34S7PR","version":1454,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9U34S7PR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9U34S7PR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Blair et al.","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Blair, Benjamin D., Lisa M.

The frequency of these incidents is not well known, particularly at modern sites that increasingly use advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this work is to determine the rate of fires and explosions at O&G sites in Colorado and Utah and apply this information to evaluate the proximity of these incidents to residences. Between 2006 and 2015, a total of 116 fires and explosions in Colorado (0.03% of active wells) and 67 fires or explosions in Utah (0.07% of active wells) were reported at O&G operations. The higher percentage of fires or explosions per number of active wells in Utah compared to Colorado (Rate Ratio=2.49, p<0.01) is likely influenced by the mandatory self-reporting requirements in Utah and the more lenient self-reporting in Colorado. The average number of residences within 1609m of the reported incident was 31 (median=3, SD=131) in the Denver Julesburg Basin and 4 (median=0, SD=10) in the Piceance Basin of Colorado. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of fires and explosions at O&G sites and offers insight into the rate and reporting of these events.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"29","issue":"","pages":"36-43","date":"July 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2017.04.014","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Is reporting “significant damage” transparent?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629617301081","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Explosions","type":1},{"tag":"Fire","type":1},{"tag":"Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Mandatory reporting","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Risk","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z","dateString":"July 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"4DU34I9W","version":6,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4DU34I9W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4DU34I9W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Heal","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Heal, Geoffrey. &#x201C;Reflections&#x2014;What Would It Take to Reduce U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80 Percent by 2050?&#x201D; <i>Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</i> 11, no. 2 (July 1, 2017): 319&#x2013;35. https://doi.org/10.1093/reep/rex014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4DU34I9W","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Reflections—What Would It Take to Reduce U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80 Percent by 2050?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Heal"}],"abstractNote":"This article investigates the cost and feasibility of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.

I suggest that this goal can be reached at a net cost in the range of $37 to $135 billion/year. I assume that the goal is to be reached by extensive use of solar photovoltaic and wind energy (66 percent of generating capacity), in which case the cost of energy storage will play a key role in the overall cost. I draw the tentative conclusion that a more limited use of renewables (less than 50 percent) together with increased use of nuclear power might be less costly.","publicationTitle":"Review of Environmental Economics and Policy","volume":"11","issue":"2","pages":"319-335","date":"2017/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rev Environ Econ Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/reep/rex014","ISSN":"1750-6816","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/11/2/319/3964517","accessDate":"2017-10-30T14:15:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"July 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"3SPS4NUJ","version":591,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3SPS4NUJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3SPS4NUJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick et al.","parsedDate":"2017-06-23","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

In DJ, Uintah, and FV, 72–83% of total measured emissions were from 20% of the well pads, while in UGR the highest 20% of emitting well pads only contributed 54% of total emissions. The total mass of methane emitted as a percent of gross methane produced, termed throughput-normalized methane average (TNMA) and determined by bootstrapping measurements from each basin, varied widely between basins and was (95% CI): 0.09% (0.05–0.15%) in FV, 0.18% (0.12–0.29%) in UGR, 2.1% (1.1–3.9%) in DJ, and 2.8% (1.0–8.6%) in Uintah. Overall, wet-gas basins (UGR, DJ, Uintah) had higher TNMA emissions than the dry-gas FV at all ranges of production per well pad. Among wet basins, TNMA emissions had a strong negative correlation with average gas production per well pad, suggesting that consolidation of operations onto single pads may reduce normalized emissions (average number of wells per pad is 5.3 in UGR versus 1.3 in Uintah and 2.8 in DJ).","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"15","pages":"8832-8840","date":"June 19, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.7b00571","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-23T12:24:46Z","dateModified":"2018-06-23T12:26:43Z","dateString":"June 19, 2017","dateValue":"2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9LNTLELW","version":183,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9LNTLELW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9LNTLELW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kersting et al.","parsedDate":"2017-04-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kersting, Jan, Vicki Duscha, Joachim Schleich, and Kimon Keramidas. &#x201C;The Impact of Shale Gas on the Costs of Climate Policy.&#x201D; <i>Climate Policy</i> 0, no. 0 (April 10, 2017): 1&#x2013;17. https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9LNTLELW","version":183,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The impact of shale gas on the costs of climate policy","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kersting"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Vicki","lastName":"Duscha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Schleich"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kimon","lastName":"Keramidas"}],"abstractNote":"The use of shale gas is commonly considered as a low-cost option for meeting ambitious climate policy targets. This article explores global and country-specific effects of increasing global shale gas exploitation on the energy markets, on greenhouse gas emissions, and on mitigation costs. The global techno-economic partial equilibrium model POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems) is employed to compare policies which limit global warming to 2°C and baseline scenarios when the availability of shale gas is either high or low. According to the simulation results, a high availability of shale gas has rather small effects on the costs of meeting climate targets in the medium and long term. In the long term, a higher availability of shale gas increases baseline emissions of greenhouse gases for most countries and for the world, and leads to higher compliance costs for most, but not all, countries. Allowing for global trading of emission certificates does not alter these general results. In sum, these findings cast doubt on shale gas’s potential as a low-cost option for meeting ambitious global climate targets.POLICY RELEVANCEMany countries with a large shale gas resource base consider the expansion of local shale gas extraction as an option to reduce their GHG emissions. The findings in this article imply that a higher availability of shale gas in these countries might actually increase emissions and mitigation costs for these countries and also for the world. An increase in shale gas extraction may spur a switch from coal to gas electricity generation, thus lowering emissions. At the global level and for many countries, though, this effect is more than offset by a crowding out of renewable and nuclear energy carriers, and by lower energy prices, leading to higher emissions and higher mitigation costs in turn. These findings would warrant a re-evaluation of the climate strategy in most countries relying on the exploitation of shale gas to meet their climate targets.","publicationTitle":"Climate Policy","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-17","date":"April 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","ISSN":"1469-3062","shortTitle":"","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","accessDate":"2017-10-26T12:59:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"energy prices","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"mitigation costs","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"April 10, 2017","dateValue":"2017-04-10T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"CEU9JE6C","version":612,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CEU9JE6C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CEU9JE6C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Patterson et al.","parsedDate":"2017-03-07","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Patterson, Lauren A., Katherine E.

These substances are widely used in, or become byproducts of unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) development and operations. Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases. More research is needed to understand the extent of these concerns in the context of UOG, but since UOG development has expanded rapidly in recent years, the need for public health prevention techniques, well-designed studies and stronger state and national regulatory standards is becoming increasingly apparent.","publicationTitle":"Reviews on Environmental Health","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1515/reveh-2017-0008","ISSN":"0048-7554","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2017-0008/reveh-2017-0008.xml?format=INT","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:52:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DeGruyter","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"BTEX","type":1},{"tag":"EDCs","type":1},{"tag":"PAHs","type":1},{"tag":"UOG","type":1},{"tag":"children","type":1},{"tag":"heavy metals","type":1},{"tag":"particulate matter","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2017","dateValue":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"X8YKQZ3L","version":600,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X8YKQZ3L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X8YKQZ3L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McKenzie LM et al.","parsedDate":"2017","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McKenzie LM, Allshouse WB, Byers TE, Bedrick EJ, Serdar B, and Adgate JL. &#x201C;Childhood Hematologic Cancer and Residential Proximity to Oil and Gas Development.&#x201D; <i>Plos One</i> 12 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170423.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X8YKQZ3L","version":600,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Childhood hematologic cancer and residential proximity to oil and gas development","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"McKenzie LM"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Allshouse WB"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Byers TE"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Bedrick EJ"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Serdar B"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Adgate JL"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Plos One","volume":"12","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170423","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:54Z","dateString":"2017","dateValue":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7HDJCHB7","version":599,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7HDJCHB7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7HDJCHB7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mark D.

However, identifying high emitters remains a challenge. We couple 163 well measurements of methane flow rates; ethane, propane, and n-butane concentrations; isotopes of methane; and noble gas concentrations from 88 wells in Pennsylvania with synthesized data from historical documents, field investigations, and state databases. Using our databases, we (i) improve estimates of the number of abandoned wells in Pennsylvania; (ii) characterize key attributes that accompany high emitters, including depth, type, plugging status, and coal area designation; and (iii) estimate attribute-specific and overall methane emissions from abandoned wells. High emitters are best predicted as unplugged gas wells and plugged/vented gas wells in coal areas and appear to be unrelated to the presence of underground natural gas storage areas or unconventional oil/gas production. Repeat measurements over 2 years show that flow rates of high emitters are sustained through time. Our attribute-based methane emission data and our comprehensive estimate of 470,000–750,000 abandoned wells in Pennsylvania result in estimated state-wide emissions of 0.04–0.07 Mt (1012 g) CH4 per year. This estimate represents 5–8% of annual anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. Our methodology combining new field measurements with data mining of previously unavailable well attributes and numbers of wells can be used to improve methane emission estimates and prioritize cost-effective mitigation strategies for Pennsylvania and beyond.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"13636-13641","date":"November 29, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1605913113","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:38Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:38Z","dateString":"November 29, 2016","dateValue":"2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"B865D5I6","version":579,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/B865D5I6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/B865D5I6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hough and Page","parsedDate":"2016-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hough, Susan E., and Morgan Page. &#x201C;Potentially Induced Earthquakes during the Early Twentieth Century in the Los Angeles Basin.&#x201D; <i>Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America</i>, November 1, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1785/0120160157.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"B865D5I6","version":579,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Potentially Induced Earthquakes during the Early Twentieth Century in the Los Angeles Basin","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Susan E.","lastName":"Hough"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Page"}],"abstractNote":"Recent studies have presented evidence that early to mid‐twentieth‐century earthquakes in Oklahoma and Texas were likely induced by fossil fuel production and/or injection of wastewater (Hough and Page, 2015; Frohlich et al., 2016). Considering seismicity from 1935 onward, Hauksson et al. (2015) concluded that there is no evidence for significant induced activity in the greater Los Angeles region between 1935 and the present. To explore a possible association between earthquakes prior to 1935 and oil and gas production, we first revisit the historical catalog and then review contemporary oil industry activities. Although early industry activities did not induce large numbers of earthquakes, we present evidence for an association between the initial oil boom in the greater Los Angeles area and earthquakes between 1915 and 1932, including the damaging 22 June 1920 Inglewood and 8 July 1929 Whittier earthquakes. We further consider whether the 1933 Mw 6.4 Long Beach earthquake might have been induced, and show some evidence that points to a causative relationship between the earthquake and activities in the Huntington Beach oil field. The hypothesis that the Long Beach earthquake was either induced or triggered by an foreshock cannot be ruled out. Our results suggest that significant earthquakes in southern California during the early twentieth century might have been associated with industry practices that are no longer employed (i.e., production without water reinjection), and do not necessarily imply a high likelihood of induced earthquakes at the present time.Online Material: Summary of background information about the Wilmington oil field, information about revisited earthquakes between 1900 and 1935, tables of felt events, and accounts of three earthquakes.","publicationTitle":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0120160157","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z","dateString":"November 1, 2016","dateValue":"2016-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"2DEQJLSE","version":1465,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2DEQJLSE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2DEQJLSE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Townsend‐Small Amy et al.","parsedDate":"2016-10-28","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Townsend&#x2010;Small Amy, Botner E.

Here we present a data set of δ2H?CH4 measurements of individual sources and air in the Colorado Front Range, USA. We show that δ2H?CH4, but not δ13C, signatures are consistent in air sampled downwind of landfills, cattle feedlots, and oil and gas wells in the region. Applying these source signatures to air in ground and aircraft samples indicates that at least 50% of CH4 emitted in the region is biogenic, perhaps because regulatory restrictions on leaking oil and natural gas wells are helping to reduce this source of CH4. Source apportionment tracers such as δ2H may help close the gap between CH4 observations and inventories, which may underestimate biogenic as well as thermogenic sources.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"21","pages":"11,462-11,471","date":"October 28, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Geophysical Research Letters","language":"","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL071438","ISSN":"0094-8276","shortTitle":"Using stable isotopes of hydrogen to quantify biogenic and thermogenic atmospheric methane sources","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL071438","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:26:29Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"cattle","type":1},{"tag":"landfill","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"stable isotopes","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:26:30Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:26:30Z","dateString":"October 28, 2016","dateValue":"2016-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"STKKACIW","version":537,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/STKKACIW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/STKKACIW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brandt et al.","parsedDate":"2016-10-14","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brandt, Adam R., Garvin A.

Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (1984–2009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y−1 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance. A range of sensitivity tests suggests that these results are robust.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"39","pages":"10791-10796","date":"09/27/2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1522923113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10791","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:37:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 27621453","tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian inversion","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric methane","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane isotopic composition","type":1},{"tag":"methane trends","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"September 27, 2016","dateValue":"2016-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"SZRHXFS6","version":620,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rasmussen et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rasmussen, Sara G., Elizabeth L.

Specific pathways of contamination have been identified; however, overall rates of contamination remain ambiguous. We used an archive of geochemical data collected from 1988 to 2014 to determine the sources and occurrence of groundwater methane in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of northeastern Colorado. This 60,000-km2 region has a 60-y-long history of hydraulic fracturing, with horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing beginning in 2010. Of 924 sampled water wells in the basin, dissolved methane was detected in 593 wells at depths of 20–190 m. Based on carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes and gas molecular ratios, most of this methane was microbially generated, likely within shallow coal seams. A total of 42 water wells contained thermogenic stray gas originating from underlying oil and gas producing formations. Inadequate surface casing and leaks in production casing and wellhead seals in older, vertical oil and gas wells were identified as stray gas migration pathways. The rate of oil and gas wellbore failure was estimated as 0.06% of the 54,000 oil and gas wells in the basin (lower estimate) to 0.15% of the 20,700 wells in the area where stray gas contamination occurred (upper estimate) and has remained steady at about two cases per year since 2001. These results show that wellbore barrier failure, not high-volume hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells, is the main cause of thermogenic stray gas migration in this oil- and gas-producing basin.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"July 11, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1523267113","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateString":"July 11, 2016","dateValue":"2016-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"SMWMETAY","version":564,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SMWMETAY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SMWMETAY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Frohlich et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-18","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Frohlich, Cliff, Heather DeShon, Brian Stump, Chris Hayward, Matt Hornbach, and Jacob I.

Here we develop a five‐question test to categorize individual events as “tectonic,” “possibly induced,” “probably induced,” or “almost certainly induced.” In Texas, the probably induced and almost certainly induced earthquakes are broadly distributed geographically—in the Fort Worth basin of north Texas, the Haynesville Shale play area of east Texas, along the Gulf Coast in south Texas, and the Permian basin of west Texas. As the technologies applied to manage petroleum fields have evolved, induced earthquakes have been associated with different practices. In fields being driven by primary recovery prior to 1940, earthquakes occurred in fields extracting high volumes of petroleum from shallow strata. Subsequently, as field pressures decreased and secondary recovery technologies became common, earthquakes also occurred in association with waterflooding operations. Since 2008, the rate of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 3 has increased from about 2 events/yr to 12 events/yr; much of this change is attributable to earthquakes occurring within a few kilometers of wastewater disposal wells injecting at high monthly rates. For three sequences monitored by temporary local seismograph networks, most hypocenters had focal depths at and deeper than the depth of injection and occurred along mapped faults situated within 2 km of injection sites. The record clearly demonstrates that induced earthquakes have been broadly distributed in several different geographic parts of Texas over the last 90 years.","publicationTitle":"Seismological Research Letters","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016-05-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0220160016","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:14Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:14Z","dateString":"May 18, 2016","dateValue":"2016-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"HG5WMCVF","version":527,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HG5WMCVF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HG5WMCVF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Akob et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-09","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Akob, Denise M., Adam C.

Through an analysis of media, policy-making, and neighborhood meeting discourse, this study examines the social construction of space through policy narratives and regional debates about the American West's relationship to extractive industries. Results reveal that the discursive struggle over suburban drilling hinges upon the question of whether industrial activities belong in residential areas and is carried out through competing policy narratives that invoke differing (spatial versus aspatial) policy solutions. The deliberative quality of these policy narratives is constrained by existing spatial policy practices and further constrains democratic engagement.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Communication","volume":"10","issue":"3","pages":"337-351","date":"May 3, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/17524032.2015.1127852","ISSN":"1752-4032","shortTitle":"New rig on the block","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2015.1127852","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"American West","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"critical discourse analysis","type":1},{"tag":"cultural sociology of space","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"suburbs","type":1}],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z","dateString":"May 3, 2016","dateValue":"2016-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"4Q6DMW7R","version":550,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4Q6DMW7R","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4Q6DMW7R","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"DiGiulio and Jackson","parsedDate":"2016-04-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">DiGiulio, Dominic C., and Robert B.

During the last 5 years, accelerated oilfield fluid injection has led to a sharp increase in the rate of earthquakes in some parts of North America. In the central United States, most induced seismicity is linked to deep disposal of coproduced wastewater from oil and gas extraction. In contrast, in western Canada most recent cases of induced seismicity are highly correlated in time and space with hydraulic fracturing, during which fluids are injected under high pressure during well completion to induce localized fracturing of rock. Furthermore, it appears that the maximum‐observed magnitude of events associated with hydraulic fracturing may exceed the predictions of an often‐cited relationship between the volume of injected fluid and the maximum expected magnitude. These findings have far‐reaching implications for assessment of induced‐seismicity hazards.","publicationTitle":"Seismological Research Letters","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 30, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0220150263","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:46Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:46Z","dateString":"March 30, 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-30T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"RIXR8EMG","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RIXR8EMG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RIXR8EMG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schaefer et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03-10","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schaefer, Hinrich, Sara E.

Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate sensitive sources. We reconstruct the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4-sink caused the [CH4]-plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn’t resume to cause the renewed [CH4]-rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4-emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"aad2705","date":"2016/03/10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aad2705","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad2705","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:36:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 26966190","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"March 10, 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-10T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":589,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/J86JGJNH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/J86JGJNH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Johnston et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Johnston, Jill E., Emily Werder, and Daniel Sebastian. &#x201C;Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas.&#x201D; <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> 106, no. 3 (March 2016): 550&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":589,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jill E.","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Werder"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sebastian"}],"abstractNote":"Objectives. To investigate race and poverty in areas where oil and gas wastewater disposal wells, which are used to permanently inject wastewater from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations, are permitted., Methods. With location data of oil and gas disposal wells permitted between 2007 and 2014 in the Eagle Ford area, a region of intensive fracking in southern Texas, we analyzed the racial composition of residents living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well and those farther away, adjusting for rurality and poverty, using a Poisson regression., Results. The proportion of people of color living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well was 1.3 times higher than was the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites. Adjusting for rurality, disposal wells were 2.04 times (95% confidence interval = 2.02, 2.06) as common in areas with 80% people of color or more than in majority White areas. Disposal wells are also disproportionately sited in high-poverty areas., Conclusions. Wastewater disposal wells in southern Texas are disproportionately permitted in areas with higher proportions of people of color and residents living in poverty, a pattern known as “environmental injustice.”","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"106","issue":"3","pages":"550-556","date":"2016-3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816143/","accessDate":"2018-01-31T22:01:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26794166\nPMCID: PMC4816143","tags":[],"collections":["X5ZEDSMQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"March 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"U3QWVFU4","version":544,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U3QWVFU4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U3QWVFU4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Casey et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Casey, Joan A., David A.

In Pennsylvania, the number of producing wells increased from 0 in 2005 to 3,689 in 2013. Few publications have focused on unconventional natural gas development and birth outcomes.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data on 9,384 mothers linked to 10,946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System from January 2009 to January 2013. We estimated cumulative exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity with an inverse-distance squared model that incorporated distance to the mother's home; dates and durations of well pad development, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing; and production volume during the pregnancy. We used multilevel linear and logistic regression models to examine associations between activity index quartile and term birth weight, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score and small size for gestational age birth, while controlling for potential confounding variables.\nRESULTS: In adjusted models, there was an association between unconventional natural gas development activity and preterm birth that increased across quartiles, with a fourth quartile odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.9). There were no associations of activity with Apgar score, small for gestational age birth, or term birth weight (after adjustment for year). In a posthoc analysis, there was an association with physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy identified from the problem list (fourth vs. first quartile, 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.7]).\nCONCLUSION: Prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with two pregnancy outcomes, adding to evidence that unconventional natural gas development may impact health.See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B14.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"27","issue":"2","pages":"163-172","date":"Mar 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Epidemiology","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000000387","ISSN":"1531-5487","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26426945\nPMCID: PMC4738074","tags":[{"tag":"Apgar Score","type":1},{"tag":"Birth Weight","type":1},{"tag":"Cohort Studies","type":1},{"tag":"Electronic Health Records","type":1},{"tag":"Female","type":1},{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Newborn","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Small for Gestational Age","type":1},{"tag":"Linear Models","type":1},{"tag":"Logistic Models","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Maternal Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Multilevel Analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Natural Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and Gas Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy Outcome","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy, High-Risk","type":1},{"tag":"Premature Birth","type":1},{"tag":"Proportional Hazards Models","type":1},{"tag":"Residence Characteristics","type":1},{"tag":"Retrospective Studies","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z","dateString":"March 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"L6XF798B","version":546,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/L6XF798B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/L6XF798B","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Conley et al.","parsedDate":"2016-02-25","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Conley, S., G.

At its peak this blowout effectively doubled the CH4 emission rate of the entire Los Angeles Basin, and in total released 97,100 metric tonnes of methane to the atmosphere.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016-02-25 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaf2348","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z","dateString":"February 25, 2016","dateValue":"2016-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"H2MJH6F4","version":1460,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H2MJH6F4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H2MJH6F4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Townsend‐Small Amy et al.","parsedDate":"2016-02-20","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Townsend&#x2010;Small Amy, Ferrara Thomas W., Lyon David R., Fries Anastasia E., and Lamb Brian K. &#x201C;Emissions of Coalbed and Natural Gas Methane from Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells in the United States.&#x201D; <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> 43, no. 5 (February 20, 2016): 2283&#x2013;90. https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067623.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"H2MJH6F4","version":1460,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Emissions of coalbed and natural gas methane from abandoned oil and gas wells in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Townsend‐Small Amy"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Ferrara Thomas W."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Lyon David R."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Fries Anastasia E."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Lamb Brian K."}],"abstractNote":"Abstract Recent work indicates that oil and gas methane (CH4) inventories for the United States are underestimated. Here we present results from direct measurements of CH4 emissions from 138 abandoned oil and gas wells, a source currently missing from inventories. Most abandoned wells do not emit CH4, but 6.5% of wells had measurable CH4 emissions. Twenty?five percent of wells we visited that had not been plugged emitted?>?5?g?CH4?h?1. Stable isotopes indicate that wells emit natural gas and/or coalbed CH4. We estimate that abandoned wells make a small contribution (<1%) to regional CH4 emissions in our study areas. Additional data are needed to accurately determine the contribution of abandoned wells to national CH4 budgets, particularly measurements in other basins and better characterization of the abundance and regional distribution of high emitters.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"5","pages":"2283-2290","date":"February 20, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Geophysical Research Letters","language":"","DOI":"10.1002/2015GL067623","ISSN":"0094-8276","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067623","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"abandoned wells","type":1},{"tag":"emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z","dateString":"February 20, 2016","dateValue":"2016-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"2IPSEMXL","version":1544,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2IPSEMXL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2IPSEMXL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Haggerty and McBride","parsedDate":"2016-02-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Haggerty, Julia, and Keegan McBride. &#x201C;Does Local Monitoring Empower Fracking Host Communities?

This paper evaluates an experimental approach to monitoring and mitigating social and economic impacts of HVHF development in Wyoming, USA between 2005 and 2009. The goal of the analysis is to assess how HVHF development in a rural setting creates unique opportunities and challenges for community-based and participatory planning and impact assessment approaches. Using archival data, oral history transcripts, and interviews, we conclude that a community-based approach can be effective as a response to HVHF development, provided there is adequate scaffolding in the form of technical and financial assistance and supporting metagovernance. We also observe that the intensity of HVHF development creates special problems that surface as strained relationships and limited capacity among key stakeholders such as local government officials, their staff, and their constituents. Well-supported community-based and participatory processes to social and economic impact assessment that encourage social learning, inclusive deliberation with transparency, and accountability can mitigate these problems, but require extensive political and administrative support to do so.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Rural Studies","volume":"43","issue":"","pages":"235-247","date":"February 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Rural Studies","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.11.005","ISSN":"0743-0167","shortTitle":"Does local monitoring empower fracking host communities?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016715300413","accessDate":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Governance","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas development","type":1},{"tag":"Social impact assessment","type":1}],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z","dateString":"February 1, 2016","dateValue":"2016-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"FTKW4E2L","version":628,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FTKW4E2L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FTKW4E2L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Saha and Muro","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

The three states examined are economically-small, relatively more rural, and have high levels of shale oil and gas reserves. They also are varied in that West Virginia is intensive in shale gas extraction, while the other two are intensive in shale oil extraction. We find significant reductions in high school and college attainment among all three states' initial residents because of the shale booms.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.12.013","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Educational Attainment"},{"tag":"Resource Curse"},{"tag":"Shale Development"},{"tag":"Synthetic Control Method"}],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:42Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:42Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"JGSZFCZ3","version":628,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JGSZFCZ3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JGSZFCZ3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ruven C.

Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N = 453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.007","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community acceptance"},{"tag":"Pennsylvania impact fees"},{"tag":"Revenue reinvestment"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas development"}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"3VYEYFUP","version":596,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3VYEYFUP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3VYEYFUP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lauer et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lauer, Nancy E., Jennifer S.

Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to &gt;8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of &gt;1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6306/1416.full.pdf","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"353","issue":"","pages":"1416-1419","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.aag0262","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"FS5RHAK5","version":537,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FS5RHAK5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FS5RHAK5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Boudet et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Boudet, Hilary, Dylan Bugden, Chad Zanocco, and Edward Maibach. &#x201C;The Effect of Industry Activities on Public Support for &#x2018;Fracking.&#x2019;&#x201D; <i>Environmental Politics</i>, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2016.1153771.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FS5RHAK5","version":537,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The effect of industry activities on public support for 'fracking'","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Boudet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Dylan Bugden"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Chad Zanocco"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Edward Maibach"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Environmental Politics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/09644016.2016.1153771","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:51Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:51Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9RCPGIRI","version":674,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9RCPGIRI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9RCPGIRI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Texas Groundwater Protection Committee","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Texas Groundwater Protection Committee. &#x201C;Joint Groundwater Monitoring and Contamination Report - 2015.&#x201D; SFR-056/15, 2016.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9RCPGIRI","version":674,"itemType":"report","title":"Joint Groundwater Monitoring and Contamination Report - 2015","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Texas Groundwater Protection Committee"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"SFR-056/15","institution":"","date":"2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:02Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:34:02Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6G6WB436","version":674,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6G6WB436","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6G6WB436","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Tsvetkova and Mark D.

We analyze the time-evolution of radiative forcing from both natural gas and coal-based electricity generation by calculating average radiative forcing over an interval of time from greenhouse gas emissions under a range of assumptions for fugitive methane leakage, electricity generation efficiency, and delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We find that leakage rates of between 5.2% and 9.9% are required for natural gas to result in greater mean forcing than coal over the next 100 years. We show that natural gas infrastructure with modest leakage could remain in place for 1.5–2.4 times the time interval that coal generation would have persisted prior to replacement with near-zero carbon technologies before the climate benefits of replacing coal with natural gas are negated. Natural gas can serve a viable bridge away from coal-based generation if avoiding longer-term climate impacts is prioritized, fugitive methane emissions are minimized, and the large-scale transition to near-zero carbon alternatives is unlikely to happen in the near-term.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"86","issue":"","pages":"286-294","date":"November 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.07.012","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300239","accessDate":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bridge fuel","type":1},{"tag":"Carbon dioxide","type":1},{"tag":"Climate change","type":1},{"tag":"Coal","type":1},{"tag":"Methane","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","dateModified":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","dateString":"November 1, 2015","dateValue":"2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7GQ9FWYI","version":551,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7GQ9FWYI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7GQ9FWYI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Drollette et al.","parsedDate":"2015-10-12","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Drollette, Brian D., Kathrin Hoelzer, Nathaniel R.

However, it is unclear whether these chemicals, injected into deep shale horizons, reach shallow groundwater aquifers and affect local water quality, either from those deep HVHF injection sites or from the surface or shallow subsurface. Here, we report detectable levels of organic compounds in shallow groundwater samples from private residential wells overlying the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. Analyses of purgeable and extractable organic compounds from 64 groundwater samples revealed trace levels of volatile organic compounds, well below the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant levels, and low levels of both gasoline range (0–8 ppb) and diesel range organic compounds (DRO; 0–157 ppb). A compound-specific analysis revealed the presence of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, which is a disclosed HVHF additive, that was notably absent in a representative geogenic water sample and field blanks. Pairing these analyses with (i) inorganic chemical fingerprinting of deep saline groundwater, (ii) characteristic noble gas isotopes, and (iii) spatial relationships between active shale gas extraction wells and wells with disclosed environmental health and safety violations, we differentiate between a chemical signature associated with naturally occurring saline groundwater and one associated with alternative anthropogenic routes from the surface (e.g., accidental spills or leaks). The data support a transport mechanism of DRO to groundwater via accidental release of fracturing fluid chemicals derived from the surface rather than subsurface flow of these fluids from the underlying shale formation.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 12, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1511474112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:09Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:09Z","dateString":"October 12, 2015","dateValue":"2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6XQYX9BZ","version":599,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marchand and Weber","parsedDate":"2015-09-30","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Marchand, Joseph, and Jeremy Weber. &#x201C;The Labor Market and School Finance Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Teacher Quality and Student Achievement.&#x201D; Working Papers.

Using shale depth variation across Texas school districts with annual oil and gas price variation, this study finds that resource development slightly decreased student achievement despite providing schools with more money. Vocational and economically disadvantaged students were pulled into the labor market, while teacher turnover and inexperience increased.

We examine the differences in levels of support and opposition to shale oil and gas development, building on the literatures of the growth-machine coalition, polluter-industrial complex, and environmental justice. Specifically, we examine different frames of shale development held by government leaders and the public who reside above the New Albany shale play in Southern Illinois and Northwest Kentucky. Using a combination of interview, survey, and participant observation data, we find that government officials emphasize economic growth and many support shale development.

Using a combination of interview, survey, and participant observation data, we find that government officials emphasize economic growth and many support shale development. While most government leaders claimed that there was not a major division in their communities about shale development, we found the public to be split, with a large countercoalition to shale development in existence.","publicationTitle":"Sociological Perspectives","volume":"58","issue":"3","pages":"441-463","date":"9/1/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sociological Perspectives","language":"en","DOI":"10.1177/0731121414567355","ISSN":"0731-1214","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0731121414567355","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:13:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"SAGE Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4","YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:13:21Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:16:39Z","dateString":"September 1, 2015","dateValue":"2015-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"JWEFG8PG","version":1052,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JWEFG8PG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JWEFG8PG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"parsedDate":"2015-08-24","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Economic Effects of Hydrofracturing on Local Economies: A Comparison of New York and Pennsylvania.&#x201D; Manhattan Institute, August 24, 2015. https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/economic-effects-hydrofracturing-local-economies-comparison-new-york-and-pennsylvania-6030.html.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"JWEFG8PG","version":1052,"itemType":"webpage","title":"The Economic Effects of Hydrofracturing on Local Economies: A Comparison of New York and Pennsylvania","creators":[],"abstractNote":"Executive Summary In 2013, New York's state government will decide whether to permit extraction of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing or, instead, turn its current moratorium into a permanent ban on this technology.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 officials before development occurred. Twelve supported introducing shale development to their communities, four were opposed, and two were undecided. Many view it as a way to overcome an economic vulnerability of their areas, population decline, by boosting the local population. Several also believe shale development will strengthen their communities’ economic specialization and social identity related to resource extraction. Although leaders held high hopes for it, most of their communities’ economic vulnerabilities are structural and likely cannot be improved by introducing shale development. This gap between hope and reality suggests that many community officials will be disappointed with major development projects – many of which are portrayed as economic boons – as they often cannot fulfill officials’ high hopes.","publicationTitle":"Community Development","volume":"46","issue":"4","pages":"312-328","date":"August 8, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/15575330.2015.1061678","ISSN":"1557-5330","shortTitle":"The hope-reality gap","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15575330.2015.1061678","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"rural economic development","type":1},{"tag":"shale development","type":1},{"tag":"unconventional shale development","type":1}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4","YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z","dateString":"August 8, 2015","dateValue":"2015-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"75BZUD5S","version":582,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/75BZUD5S","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/75BZUD5S","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jackson et al.","parsedDate":"2015-08-04","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jackson, Robert B., Ella R.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route. The policy implications of these findings for energy infrastructure siting controversies are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"83","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"99-108","date":"August 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.04.004","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Politics, proximity and the pipeline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515001469","accessDate":"2017-10-27T12:36:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Keystone XL","type":1},{"tag":"NIMBY","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Pipelines","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 1, 2015","dateValue":"2015-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"MV89TGCJ","version":186,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MV89TGCJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MV89TGCJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jemielita et al.","parsedDate":"2015-07-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jemielita, Thomas, George L.

Despite substantial increases in well drilling, the health consequences of UGOD toxicant exposure remain unclear. This study examines an association between wells and healthcare use by zip code from 2007 to 2011 in Pennsylvania. Inpatient discharge databases from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council were correlated with active wells by zip code in three counties in Pennsylvania. For overall inpatient prevalence rates and 25 specific medical categories, the association of inpatient prevalence rates with number of wells per zip code and, separately, with wells per km2 (separated into quantiles and defined as well density) were estimated using fixed-effects Poisson models. To account for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction with associations of p<0.00096 was considered statistically significant. Cardiology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with number of wells per zip code (p<0.00096) and wells per km2 (p<0.00096) while neurology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with wells per km2 (p<0.00096). Furthermore, evidence also supported an association between well density and inpatient prevalence rates for the medical categories of dermatology, neurology, oncology, and urology. These data suggest that UGOD wells, which dramatically increased in the past decade, were associated with increased inpatient prevalence rates within specific medical categories in Pennsylvania. Further studies are necessary to address healthcare costs of UGOD and determine whether specific toxicants or combinations are associated with organ-specific responses.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"7","pages":"e0131093","date":"Jul 15, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Cardiology","type":1},{"tag":"Dermatology","type":1},{"tag":"Inpatients","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Neonatology","type":1},{"tag":"Oncology","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Urology","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateString":"July 15, 2015","dateValue":"2015-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9KAFYTEF","version":1457,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9KAFYTEF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9KAFYTEF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Townsend-Small et al.","parsedDate":"2015-07-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Townsend-Small, Amy, Josette E.

Identifying fingerprints of these emissions is critical to our understanding of potential impacts. Here, we compare stable isotopic and alkane ratio tracers of natural gas, agricultural, and urban CH4 sources in the Barnett Shale hydraulic fracturing region near Fort Worth, Texas. Thermogenic and biogenic sources were compositionally distinct, and emissions from oil wells were enriched in alkanes and isotopically depleted relative to natural gas wells. Emissions from natural gas production varied in δ13C and alkane ratio composition, with δD-CH4 representing the most consistent tracer of natural gas sources. We integrated our data into a bottom-up inventory of CH4 for the region, resulting in an inventory of ethane (C2H6) sources for comparison to top-down estimates of CH4 and C2H6 emissions. Methane emissions in the Barnett are a complex mixture of urban, agricultural, and fossil fuel sources, which makes source apportionment challenging. For example, spatial heterogeneity in gas composition and high C2H6/CH4 ratios in emissions from conventional oil production add uncertainty to top-down models of source apportionment. Future top-down studies may benefit from the addition of δD-CH4 to distinguish thermogenic and biogenic sources.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8175-8182","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Eighteen source categories were estimated using multiple data sets, including new empirical measurements at regional O&G sites and a national study of gathering and processing facilities. Spatially referenced activity data were compiled from federal and state databases and combined with O&G facility emission factors calculated using Monte Carlo simulations that account for high emission sites representing the very upper portion, or fat-tail, in the observed emissions distributions. Total methane emissions in the 25-county Barnett Shale region in October 2013 were estimated to be 72,300 (63,400–82,400) kg CH4 h–1. O&G emissions were estimated to be 46,200 (40,000–54,100) kg CH4 h–1 with 19% of emissions from fat-tail sites representing less than 2% of sites. Our estimate of O&G emissions in the Barnett Shale region was higher than alternative inventories based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Inventory, EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research by factors of 1.5, 2.7, and 4.3, respectively. Gathering compressor stations, which accounted for 40% of O&G emissions in our inventory, had the largest difference from emission estimates based on EPA data sources. Our inventory’s higher O&G emission estimate was due primarily to its more comprehensive activity factors and inclusion of emissions from fat-tail sites.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8147-8157","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1021/es506359c","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-23T12:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-06-23T12:32:27Z","dateString":"July 7, 2015","dateValue":"2015-07-07T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"PNWGEUG7","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Walsh and Zoback","parsedDate":"2015-06-18","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Walsh, F.

In three study areas that encompass the vast majority of the recent seismicity, we show that the increases in seismicity follow 5- to 10-fold increases in the rates of saltwater disposal. Adjacent areas where there has been relatively little saltwater disposal have had comparatively few recent earthquakes. In the areas of seismic activity, the saltwater disposal principally comes from “produced” water, saline pore water that is coproduced with oil and then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although most of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted.Keywords","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"1","issue":"5","pages":"","date":"2015-06-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1500195","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Oklahoma’s recent earthquakes and saltwater disposal","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/advances/1/5/e1500195.full.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"June 18, 2015","dateValue":"2015-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"Q44LHBX2","version":577,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q44LHBX2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q44LHBX2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hildenbrand et al.","parsedDate":"2015-06-16","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hildenbrand, Zacariah Louis, Doug D.

However, because of potential social and environmental drawbacks, including a lack of affordable housing and groundwater contamination from drilling, unconventional shale development is highly contentious in many areas and has resulted in many community conflicts. Hydraulic fracturing, which is a specific technology utilized in unconventional shale development, has proved especially contentious because of concerns about its long-term environmental consequences. Given the fast pace of shale development, coupled with the controversy that surrounds it, we seek to understand what factors affect a local government official's stance on shale development and hydraulic fracturing. To do this we draw from value-belief-norms theory while additionally examining knowledge and community-level factors that can influence an official's position. In this study, we survey 308 local government officials across six shale plays in the United States to examine local officials' positions on shale development and hydraulic fracturing. We find that the more positively officials perceive the consequences of shale development, the less likely they are to support banning hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, we find that networks to other shale communities are positively associated with favoring a ban. Further, leaders with a bachelor's degree or higher are more likely to favor a ban than those with lower than a bachelor's degree.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"80","issue":"4","pages":"397-430","date":"5/29/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12071","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ruso.12071","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:14:52Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2015, by the Rural Sociological Society","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:14:52Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:17:42Z","dateString":"May 29, 2015","dateValue":"2015-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6RMH877P","version":567,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RMH877P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RMH877P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2015-05-19","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

For example, groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and spillage of brine and other gas drilling-related fluids is known to occur. However, contamination of shallow potable aquifers by HVHF at depth has never been fully documented. We investigated a case where Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania caused inundation of natural gas and foam in initially potable groundwater used by several households. With comprehensive 2D gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), an unresolved complex mixture of organic compounds was identified in the aquifer. Similar signatures were also observed in flowback from Marcellus Shale gas wells. A compound identified in flowback, 2-n-Butoxyethanol, was also positively identified in one of the foaming drinking water wells at nanogram-per-liter concentrations. The most likely explanation of the incident is that stray natural gas and drilling or HF compounds were driven ∼1–3 km along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the aquifer used as a potable water source. Part of the problem may have been wastewaters from a pit leak reported at the nearest gas well pad—the only nearby pad where wells were hydraulically fractured before the contamination incident. If samples of drilling, pit, and HVHF fluids had been available, GCxGC-TOFMS might have fingerprinted the contamination source. Such evaluations would contribute significantly to better management practices as the shale gas industry expands worldwide.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 4, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1420279112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z","dateString":"May 4, 2015","dateValue":"2015-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"VE75HVTI","version":613,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VE75HVTI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VE75HVTI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Paulik et al.","parsedDate":"2015-04-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Paulik, L.

We report natural gas emission rates for 1 y in the urban region of Boston, using a comprehensive atmospheric measurement and modeling framework. Continuous methane observations from four stations are combined with a high-resolution transport model to quantify the regional average emission flux, 18.5 ± 3.7 (95% confidence interval) g CH4⋅m−2⋅y−1. Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, compared with the ethane-to-methane ratio in the pipeline gas delivered to the region, demonstrate that natural gas accounted for ∼60–100% of methane emissions, depending on season. Using government statistics and geospatial data on natural gas use, we find the average fractional loss rate to the atmosphere from all downstream components of the natural gas system, including transmission, distribution, and end use, was 2.7 ± 0.6% in the Boston urban region, with little seasonal variability. This fraction is notably higher than the 1.1% implied by the most closely comparable emission inventory.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"","pages":"1941-1946","date":"February 17, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1416261112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:02Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:02Z","dateString":"February 17, 2015","dateValue":"2015-02-17T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"XW3ZCP23","version":585,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XW3ZCP23","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XW3ZCP23","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"James","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">James, Alexander. &#x201C;US State Fiscal Policy and Natural Resources.&#x201D; <i>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</i> 7, no. 3 (2015): 238&#x2013;57. https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20130211.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"XW3ZCP23","version":585,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"US State Fiscal Policy and Natural Resources","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"James"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"American Economic Journal: Economic Policy","volume":"7","issue":"3","pages":"238-57","date":"2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1257/pol.20130211","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"US State Fiscal Policy and Natural Resources","url":"http://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20130211","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2015","dateValue":"2015-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KTH8LWLU","version":595,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KTH8LWLU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KTH8LWLU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kyle E.

If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources2. The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions3,4,5,6. Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal7,8. Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energy–economy–climate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope9,10 or its coverage of greenhouse gases2. Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models11 of energy–economy–climate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from −2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from −0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy9,10.","publicationTitle":"Nature","volume":"514","issue":"7523","pages":"482-485","date":"2014-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/nature13837","ISSN":"1476-4687","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13837","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2014 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","dateString":"October 2014","dateValue":"2014-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"YUXSHNZM","version":479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Maniloff and Mastromonaco","parsedDate":"2014-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Maniloff, Peter, and Ralph Mastromonaco. &#x201C;The Local Economic Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing and Determinants of Dutch Disease.&#x201D; Working Papers.

First, using government local economic data matched to highly detailed national oil and natural gas panel data, we estimate the effect that new \"fracking\" installations have on local job growth and average earnings, controlling for time-varying unobserved determinants of job growth, overall, by industry, and by region. We find that overall employment effects are substantial although smaller than some previous studies. Second, we show that shale development increases wages in manufacturing in counties with relatively tight labor markets and little prior oil and gas industry presence.

In North America, these unconventional domestic sources of natural gas and oil provide an opportunity to achieve energy self-sufficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when displacing coal as a source of energy in power plants. However, fugitive methane emissions in the production process may counter the benefit over coal with respect to climate change and therefore need to be well quantified. Here we demonstrate that positive methane anomalies associated with the oil and gas industries can be detected from space and that corresponding regional emissions can be constrained using satellite observations. On the basis of a mass-balance approach, we estimate that methane emissions for two of the fastest growing production regions in the United States, the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, have increased by 990 ± 650 ktCH4 yr−1 and 530 ± 330 ktCH4 yr−1 between the periods 2006–2008 and 2009–2011. Relative to the respective increases in oil and gas production, these emission estimates correspond to leakages of 10.1% ± 7.3% and 9.1% ± 6.2% in terms of energy content, calling immediate climate benefit into question and indicating that current inventories likely underestimate the fugitive emissions from Bakken and Eagle Ford.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"2","issue":"10","pages":"2014EF000265","date":"October 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Earth's Future","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2014EF000265","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EF000265/abstract","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:30:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"1610 Atmosphere","type":1},{"tag":"1616 Climate variability","type":1},{"tag":"3360 Remote sensing","type":1},{"tag":"6324 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"6615 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"fugitive emissions","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas production","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"October 1, 2014","dateValue":"2014-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Davis","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Davis, Charles. &#x201C;Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 48, no. 15 (August 5, 2014): 8397&#x2013;8403. https://doi.org/10.1021/es405095y.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Davis"}],"abstractNote":"State officials responsible for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations used in the production of oil and gas resources will inevitably confront a key policy issue; that is, to what extent can statewide regulations be developed without reducing land use autonomy typically exercised by local officials? Most state regulators have historically recognized the economic importance of industry jobs and favor the adoption of uniform regulatory requirements even if these rules preempt local policymaking authority. Conversely, many local officials seek to preserve land use autonomy to provide a greater measure of protection for public health and environmental quality goals. This paper examines how public officials in three states—Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Texas—address the question of state control versus local autonomy through their efforts to shape fracking policy decisions. While local officials within Texas have succeeded in developing fracking ordinances with relatively little interference from state regulators, Colorado and Pennsylvania have adopted a tougher policy stance favoring the retention of preemptive oil and gas statutes. Key factors that account for between state differences in fracking policy decisions include the strength of home rule provisions, gubernatorial involvement, and the degree of local experience with industrial economic activities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8397-8403","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations. Abundant natural gas can, however, help reduce the costs of achieving GHG reduction goals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8360-8368","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

We study how shale gas development affected zip code level housing values in Texas’ Barnett Shale, which splits the Dallas-Fort Worth region in half and is the most extensively developed shale formation in the U.S. We find that housing in shale zip codes appreciated more than nonshale zip codes during peak development and less afterwards, with a net positive effect of five to six percentage points from 1997 to 2013. The greater appreciation in part reflects improved local public finances: the value of natural gas rights expanded the local tax base by $82,000 per student, increasing school revenues and expenditures. Within shale zip codes, however, an extra well per square kilometer was associated with a 1.6 percentage point decrease in appreciation over the study period.","reportNumber":"ID 2467622","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2014/07/17","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Shale Gas Development and Housing Values over a Decade","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2467622","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Barnett Shale","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"property values","type":1}],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","dateString":"July 17, 2014","dateValue":"2014-07-17T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"BFYZKAUZ","version":671,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BFYZKAUZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BFYZKAUZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schwietzke et al.","parsedDate":"2014-07-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schwietzke, Stefan, W.

Since 2008, a rapid increase in Marcellus Shale gas production has led to a commensurate rise in associated wastewater while generation of produced water from conventional oil and gas activities has continued. In this study, we assess whether disposal practices from treatment of produced waters from both shale gas and conventional operations in Pennsylvania could result in the accumulation of associated alkali earth elements. The results from our 5 study sites indicate that there was no increase in concentrations of total Ra (Ra-226) and extractable Ba, Ca, Na, or Sr in fluvial sediments downstream of the discharge outfalls (p>0.05) of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and centralized waste treatment facilities (CWTs). However, the use of road spreading of brines from conventional oil and gas wells for deicing resulted in accumulation of Ra-226 (1.2×), and extractable Sr (3.0×), Ca (5.3×), and Na (6.2×) in soil and sediment proximal to roads (p<0.05). Although this study is an important initial assessment of the impacts of these disposal practices, more work is needed to consider the environmental consequences of produced waters management.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Coal Geology","volume":"126","issue":"","pages":"162-170","date":"June 1, 2014","series":"Environmental geology and the unconventional gas revolution","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Coal Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.coal.2013.12.001","ISSN":"0166-5162","shortTitle":"Surface disposal of produced waters in western and southwestern Pennsylvania","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516213002681","accessDate":"2018-02-12T15:17:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Conventional gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental impact","type":1},{"tag":"Produced waters disposal","type":1},{"tag":"Sediment contaminant","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"June 1, 2014","dateValue":"2014-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"JIJSQ2CN","version":585,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JIJSQ2CN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JIJSQ2CN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jeong et al.","parsedDate":"2014-05-20","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jeong, Seongeun, Dev Millstein, and Marc L.

However, because of the high global warming potential of methane (CH4, the major component of NG), climate benefits from NG use depend on system leakage rates. Some recent estimates of leakage have challenged the benefits of switching from coal to NG, a large near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunity (1–3). Also, global atmospheric CH4 concentrations are on the rise, with the causes still poorly understood (4).\nMethane emissions from U.S. and Canadian natural gas systems appear larger than official estimates.\nMethane emissions from U.S. and Canadian natural gas systems appear larger than official estimates.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"343","issue":"6172","pages":"733-735","date":"2014/02/14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1247045","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/733","accessDate":"2018-01-05T14:11:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 24531957","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"February 14, 2014","dateValue":"2014-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"HVCDK94Z","version":474,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HVCDK94Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HVCDK94Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Li and Carlson","parsedDate":"2014-02-04","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Li, Huishu, and Kenneth H.

One of the issues of concern is the migration of oil, gas, or produced water to a groundwater aquifer resulting in contamination of drinking water. Since methane is the major component of natural gas and it can be dissolved and transported with groundwater, stray gas in aquifers has elicited attention. The initial step toward understanding the environmental impacts of oil and gas activities, such as well drilling and fracturing, is to determine the occurrence, where it is and where it came from. In this study, groundwater methane data that has been collected in response to a relatively new regulation in Colorado is analyzed. Dissolved methane was detected in 78% of groundwater wells with an average concentration of 4.0 mg/L and a range of 0–37.1 mg/L. Greater than 95% of the methane found in groundwater wells was classified as having a microbial origin, and there was minimal overlap between the C and H isotopic characterization of the produced gas and dissolved methane measured in the aquifer. Neither density of oil/gas wells nor distance to oil/gas wells had a significant impact on methane concentration suggesting other important factors were influencing methane generation and distribution. Thermogenic methane was detected in two aquifer wells indicating a potential contamination pathway from the producing formation, but microbial-origin gas was by far the predominant source of dissolved methane in the Wattenberg field.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"3","pages":"1484-1491","date":"February 4, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Hundreds of products containing more than 750 chemicals and components are potentially used throughout the extraction process, including more than 100 known or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We hypothesized that a selected subset of chemicals used in natural gas drilling operations and also surface and ground water samples collected in a drilling-dense region of Garfield County, Colorado, would exhibit estrogen and androgen receptor activities. Water samples were collected, solid-phase extracted, and measured for estrogen and androgen receptor activities using reporter gene assays in human cell lines. Of the 39 unique water samples, 89%, 41%, 12%, and 46% exhibited estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic activities, respectively. Testing of a subset of natural gas drilling chemicals revealed novel antiestrogenic, novel antiandrogenic, and limited estrogenic activities. The Colorado River, the drainage basin for this region, exhibited moderate levels of estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activities, suggesting that higher localized activity at sites with known natural gas–related spills surrounding the river might be contributing to the multiple receptor activities observed in this water source. The majority of water samples collected from sites in a drilling-dense region of Colorado exhibited more estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or antiandrogenic activities than reference sites with limited nearby drilling operations.

Sampling was conducted before, during, and after drilling and hydraulic fracturing of a new natural gas well pad. Weekly air sampling for 1 year revealed that the number of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and their concentrations were highest during the initial drilling phase and did not increase during hydraulic fracturing in this closed-loop system. Methylene chloride, a toxic solvent not reported in products used in drilling or hydraulic fracturing, was detected 73% of the time; several times in high concentrations. A literature search of the health effects of the NMHCs revealed that many had multiple health effects, including 30 that affect the endocrine system, which is susceptible to chemical impacts at very low concentrations, far less than government safety standards. Selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were at concentrations greater than those at which prenatally exposed children in urban studies had lower developmental and IQ scores. The human and environmental health impacts of the NMHCs, which are ozone precursors, should be examined further given that the natural gas industry is now operating in close proximity to human residences and public lands.","publicationTitle":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal","volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":"86-105","date":"January 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/10807039.2012.749447","ISSN":"1080-7039","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2012.749447","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"PAHs","type":1},{"tag":"VOCs","type":1},{"tag":"drilling","type":1},{"tag":"endocrine disruptors","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"non-methane hydrocarbons","type":1}],"collections":["FUGV49UB","UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z","dateString":"January 1, 2014","dateValue":"2014-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"QHYS9FRX","version":671,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QHYS9FRX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QHYS9FRX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Small et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Small, Mitchell J., Paul C.

Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are ∼2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 ± 3% of national emissions. The spatial patterns of our emission fluxes and observed methane–propane correlations indicate that fossil fuel extraction and refining are major contributors (45 ± 13%) in the south-central United States. This result suggests that regional methane emissions due to fossil fuel extraction and processing could be 4.9 ± 2.6 times larger than in EDGAR, the most comprehensive global methane inventory. These results cast doubt on the US EPA’s recent decision to downscale its estimate of national natural gas emissions by 25–30%. Overall, we conclude that methane emissions associated with both the animal husbandry and fossil fuel industries have larger greenhouse gas impacts than indicated by existing inventories.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"November 25, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1314392110","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:07Z","dateString":"November 25, 2013","dateValue":"2013-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"HNVFMBRQ","version":504,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HNVFMBRQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HNVFMBRQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fontenot et al.","parsedDate":"2013-09-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fontenot, Brian E., Laura R.

Here, we present an assessment of private well water quality in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale formation of North Texas. We evaluated samples from 100 private drinking water wells using analytical chemistry techniques. Analyses revealed that arsenic, selenium, strontium and total dissolved solids (TDS) exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant Limit (MCL) in some samples from private water wells located within 3 km of active natural gas wells. Lower levels of arsenic, selenium, strontium, and barium were detected at reference sites outside the Barnett Shale region as well as sites within the Barnett Shale region located more than 3 km from active natural gas wells. Methanol and ethanol were also detected in 29% of samples. Samples exceeding MCL levels were randomly distributed within areas of active natural gas extraction, and the spatial patterns in our data suggest that elevated constituent levels could be due to a variety of factors including mobilization of natural constituents, hydrogeochemical changes from lowering of the water table, or industrial accidents such as faulty gas well casings.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"17","pages":"10032-10040","date":"Sep 03, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Of the 198 possible examples, magnitudes range up to 7.9. The potential causes and magnitudes are (a) mining (M 1.6–5.6); (b) oil and gas field depletion (M 1.0–7.3); (c) water injection for secondary oil recovery (M 1.9–5.1); (d) reservoir impoundment (M 2.0–7.9); (e) waste disposal (M 2.0–5.3); (f) academic research boreholes investigating induced seismicity and stress (M 2.8–3.1); (g) solution mining (M 1.0–5.2); (h) geothermal operations (M 1.0–4.6) and (i) hydraulic fracturing for recovery of gas and oil from low-permeability sedimentary rocks (M 1.0–3.8). Reactivation of faults and resultant seismicity occurs due to a reduction in effective stress on fault planes. Hydraulic fracturing operations can trigger seismicity because it can cause an increase in the fluid pressure in a fault zone. Based upon the research compiled here we propose that this could occur by three mechanisms. Firstly, fracturing fluid or displaced pore fluid could enter the fault. Secondly, there may be direct connection with the hydraulic fractures and a fluid pressure pulse could be transmitted to the fault. Lastly, due to poroelastic properties of rock, deformation or ‘inflation’ due to hydraulic fracturing could increase fluid pressure in the fault or in fractures connected to the fault. The following pathways for fluid or a fluid pressure pulse are proposed: (a) directly from the wellbore; (b) through new, stimulated hydraulic fractures; (c) through pre-existing fractures and minor faults; or (d) through the pore network of permeable beds or along bedding planes. The reactivated fault could be intersected by the wellbore or it could be 10s to 100s of metres from it. We propose these mechanisms have been responsible for the three known examples of felt seismicity that are probably induced by hydraulic fracturing. These are in the USA, Canada and the UK. The largest such earthquake was M 3.8 and was in the Horn River Basin, Canada. To date, hydraulic fracturing has been a relatively benign mechanism compared to other anthropogenic triggers, probably because of the low volumes of fluid and short pumping times used in hydraulic fracturing operations. These data and analysis should help provide useful context and inform the current debate surrounding hydraulic fracturing technology.","publicationTitle":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","volume":"45","issue":"","pages":"171-185","date":"August 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.03.016","ISSN":"0264-8172","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817213000846","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Earthquake","type":1},{"tag":"Fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Induced","type":1},{"tag":"Seismic","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z","dateString":"August 1, 2013","dateValue":"2013-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9D8TBQB8","version":950,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9D8TBQB8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9D8TBQB8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Warner et al.","parsedDate":"2013-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Warner, Nathaniel R., Timothy M.

The accelerated production of natural gas has triggered a debate concerning the safety and possible environmental impacts of these operations. This study investigates one of the critical aspects of the environmental effects; the possible degradation of water quality in shallow aquifers overlying producing shale formations. The geochemistry of domestic groundwater wells was investigated in aquifers overlying the Fayetteville Shale in north-central Arkansas, where approximately 4000 wells have been drilled since 2004 to extract unconventional natural gas. Monitoring was performed on 127 drinking water wells and the geochemistry of major ions, trace metals, CH4 gas content and its C isotopes (δ13CCH4), and select isotope tracers (δ11B, 87Sr/86Sr, δ2H, δ18O, δ13CDIC) compared to the composition of flowback-water samples directly from Fayetteville Shale gas wells. Dissolved CH4 was detected in 63% of the drinking-water wells (32 of 51 samples), but only six wells exceeded concentrations of 0.5mg CH4/L. The δ13CCH4 of dissolved CH4 ranged from −42.3‰ to −74.7‰, with the most negative values characteristic of a biogenic source also associated with the highest observed CH4 concentrations, with a possible minor contribution of trace amounts of thermogenic CH4. The majority of these values are distinct from the reported thermogenic composition of the Fayetteville Shale gas (δ13CCH4=−35.4‰ to −41.9‰). Based on major element chemistry, four shallow groundwater types were identified: (1) low (<100mg/L) total dissolved solids (TDS), (2) TDS>100mg/L and Ca–HCO3 dominated, (3) TDS>100mg/L and Na–HCO3 dominated, and (4) slightly saline groundwater with TDS>100mg/L and Cl>20mg/L with elevated Br/Cl ratios (>0.001). The Sr (87Sr/86Sr=0.7097–0.7166), C (δ13CDIC=−21.3‰ to −4.7‰), and B (δ11B=3.9–32.9‰) isotopes clearly reflect water–rock interactions within the aquifer rocks, while the stable O and H isotopic composition mimics the local meteoric water composition. Overall, there was a geochemical gradient from low-mineralized recharge water to more evolved Ca–HCO3, and higher-mineralized Na–HCO3 composition generated by a combination of carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering, and reverse base-exchange reactions. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the bulk shallow groundwater samples were distinct from the Na–Cl type Fayetteville flowback/produced waters (TDS ∼10,000–20,000mg/L). Yet, the high Br/Cl variations in a small subset of saline shallow groundwater suggest that they were derived from dilution of saline water similar to the brine in the Fayetteville Shale. Nonetheless, no spatial relationship was found between CH4 and salinity occurrences in shallow drinking water wells with proximity to shale-gas drilling sites. The integration of multiple geochemical and isotopic proxies shows no direct evidence of contamination in shallow drinking-water aquifers associated with natural gas extraction from the Fayetteville Shale.","publicationTitle":"Applied Geochemistry","volume":"35","issue":"","pages":"207-220","date":"August 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Geochemistry","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.04.013","ISSN":"0883-2927","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292713001133","accessDate":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z","dateModified":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z","dateString":"August 1, 2013","dateValue":"2013-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"M9RPUDN9","version":1486,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M9RPUDN9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M9RPUDN9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Krupnick, Alan, Zhongmin Wang, and Yushuang Wang. &#x201C;Sector Effects of the Shale Gas Revolution in the United States.&#x201D; SSRN Scholarly Paper.

In reality, however, a range of human activity can also induce earthquakes. Ellsworth (p. 10.1126/science.1225942) reviews the current understanding of the causes and mechanics of earthquakes caused by human activity and the means to decrease their associated risk. Notable examples include injection of wastewater into deep formations and emerging technologies related to oil and gas recovery, including hydraulic fracturing. In addition to directly causing increased local seismic activity, activities such as deep fluid injection may have other ramifications related to earthquake occurrence. Van der Elst et al. (p. 164; see the news story by Kerr) demonstrate that in the midwestern United States, some areas with increased human-induced seismicity are also more prone to further earthquakes triggered by the seismic waves from large, remote earthquakes. Improved seismic monitoring and injection data near deep disposal sites will help to identify regions prone to remote triggering and, more broadly, suggest times when activities should, at least temporarily, be put on hold.\nA recent dramatic increase in seismicity in the midwestern United States may be related to increases in deep wastewater injection. Here, we demonstrate that areas with suspected anthropogenic earthquakes are also more susceptible to earthquake-triggering from natural transient stresses generated by the seismic waves of large remote earthquakes. Enhanced triggering susceptibility suggests the presence of critically loaded faults and potentially high fluid pressures. Sensitivity to remote triggering is most clearly seen in sites with a long delay between the start of injection and the onset of seismicity and in regions that went on to host moderate magnitude earthquakes within 6 to 20 months. Triggering in induced seismic zones could therefore be an indicator that fluid injection has brought the fault system to a critical state.\nWastewater injected deep underground can make some faults more susceptible to triggering by large remote earthquakes.\nWastewater injected deep underground can make some faults more susceptible to triggering by large remote earthquakes.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"341","issue":"6142","pages":"164-167","date":"2013/07/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1238948","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/164","accessDate":"2018-05-07T17:10:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 23846900","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T17:10:55Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T17:10:55Z","dateString":"July 12, 2013","dateValue":"2013-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"RNVTJ94G","version":564,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fryzek et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fryzek, Jon, Susan Pastula, Xiaohui Jiang, and David H.

This paper therefore attempts to explain the behavior of natural gas index returns and in so doing proposes application of a pure Markov-switching volatility model whose variance is subject to shift in regime. We show that regime-switching is clearly present in the natural gas market and such should not be ignored. All ARCH effects that show up in weekly natural gas index returns data die out almost completely after allowing for Markov-switching variance. Volatility regimes identified by our model correlate well with major events affecting supply and demand for natural gas. Out-of-sample tests indicate that the regime switching model performs noticeably better than a wide range of volatility models considered regardless of evaluation criteria, thus providing a better framework for the policy maker or financial historian interested in studying factors behind the evolution of volatility and to natural gas futures traders interested in short-term volatility forecasts. As risk-hedging decisions rely critically on assumptions about volatility, policies based on the transition probabilities are likely to be more conservative.","publicationTitle":"Energy","volume":"55","issue":"","pages":"553-563","date":"June 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.082","ISSN":"0360-5442","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421300279X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Natural gas price","type":1},{"tag":"Regime-switching","type":1},{"tag":"Volatility forecasts","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","dateString":"June 15, 2013","dateValue":"2013-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"CGCIZ8X8","version":188,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CGCIZ8X8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CGCIZ8X8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Witter et al.","parsedDate":"2013-06","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Witter, Roxana Z., Lisa McKenzie, Kaylan E.

The analysis employs the most extensive data set of any LCA of shale gas to date, encompassing data from actual gas production and power generation operations. Results indicate that a typical Marcellus gas life cycle yields 466 kg CO2eq/MWh (80% confidence interval: 450–567 kg CO2eq/MWh) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 224 gal/MWh (80% CI: 185–305 gal/MWh) of freshwater consumption. Operations associated with hydraulic fracturing constitute only 1.2% of the life cycle GHG emissions, and 6.2% of the life cycle freshwater consumption. These results are influenced most strongly by the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of the well and the power plant efficiency: increase in either quantity will reduce both life cycle freshwater consumption and GHG emissions relative to power generated at the plant. We conclude by comparing the life cycle impacts of Marcellus gas and U.S. coal: The carbon footprint of Marcellus gas is 53% (80% CI: 44–61%) lower than coal, and its freshwater consumption is about 50% of coal. We conclude that substantial GHG reductions and freshwater savings may result from the replacement of coal-fired power generation with gas-fired power generation.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"9","pages":"4896-4903","date":"May 7, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The absence of comprehensive federal legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing has placed the regulation of unconventional gas drilling primarily within the purview of state and local governments. This report examines public opinion in Michigan and Pennsylvania on a series of issues concerning the impact of fracking on the economy, environmental protection, and information disclosure. Pennsylvania and Michigan have been selected as the focus of this report because they represent states with varied levels of hydraulic fracturing within their borders. Pennsylvania has emerged as one of the nation’s leaders in terms of the number of hydraulic fracturing sites with extensive drilling occurring in the commonwealth, and also has high levels of public debate and policy development related to this issue. Conversely, fracking has just begun to develop on a large scale within Michigan with corresponding public engagement around the matter in its early stages. These differences present a valuable opportunity to examine where the public in these two states stands on an array of issues related to fracking.","reportNumber":"ID 2313276","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2013/05/01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"The National Surveys on Energy and Environment Public Opinion on Fracking","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2313276","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"CLOSUP","type":1},{"tag":"Michigan","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"climate change","type":1},{"tag":"energy","type":1},{"tag":"environment","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"national surveys on energy and environment","type":1},{"tag":"survey","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z","dateString":"May 1, 2013","dateValue":"2013-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7WRFNNC5","version":350,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7WRFNNC5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7WRFNNC5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kiviat","parsedDate":"2013-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kiviat, Erik. &#x201C;Risks to Biodiversity from Hydraulic Fracturing for Natural Gas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales.&#x201D; <i>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</i> 1286 (May 2013): 1&#x2013;14. https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12146.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7WRFNNC5","version":350,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Risks to biodiversity from hydraulic fracturing for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica shales","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Kiviat"}],"abstractNote":"High-volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing (HVHHF) for mining natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales is widespread in Pennsylvania and potentially throughout approximately 280,000 km(2) of the Appalachian Basin. Physical and chemical impacts of HVHHF include pollution by toxic synthetic chemicals, salt, and radionuclides, landscape fragmentation by wellpads, pipelines, and roads, alteration of stream and wetland hydrology, and increased truck traffic. Despite concerns about human health, there has been little study of the impacts on habitats and biota. Taxa and guilds potentially sensitive to HVHHF impacts include freshwater organisms (e.g., brook trout, freshwater mussels), fragmentation-sensitive biota (e.g., forest-interior breeding birds, forest orchids), and species with restricted geographic ranges (e.g., Wehrle's salamander, tongue-tied minnow).

However, little attention has been paid to the potentialfor groundwater contamination resulting from surface spills from storage and production facilities at active well sites. We performed a search for publically available data regarding groundwater contamination from spills at ULS. drilling sites. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) database was selected for further analysis because it was the most detailed. The majority ofspills were in Weld County, Colorado, which has the highest density of wells that used hydraulic fracturing for completion, many producing both methane gas and crude oil. We analyzed publically available data reported by operators to the COGCC regarding surface spills that impacted groundwater From July 2010 to July 2011, we noted 77 reported surface spills impacting the groundwater in Weld County, which resulted in surface spills associated with less than 0.5% of the active wells. The reported data included groundwater samples that were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, andxylene (BTEX) components of crude oil. For groundwater samples taken both within the spill excavation area and on the first reported date of sampling, the BTEX measurements exceeded National Drinking Water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in 90, 30, 12, and 8% of the samples, respectively. However, actions taken to remediate the spills were effective at reducing BJTEX levels, with at least 84% of the spills reportedly achieving remediation as of May 2012. Our analysis demonstrates that surface spills are an important route of potential groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing activities and should be a focus of programs to protect groundwater\nIMPLICATIONS: While benzene can occur naturally in groundwater sources, spills and migration of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing activities have recently been thought to be a main source of benzene contamination in groundwater. However, there is little scientific literature to support that claim. Therefore, we accessed a publically available database and tracked the number of reported surface spills with potential groundwater impact over a 1-year period. Although the number of surface spills was minimal, our analysis provides scientific evidence that benzene can contaminate groundwater sources following surface spills at active well sites.","publicationTitle":"Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)","volume":"63","issue":"4","pages":"424-432","date":"Apr 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J Air Waste Manag Assoc","language":"eng","DOI":"","ISSN":"1096-2247","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23687727","tags":[{"tag":"Benzene","type":1},{"tag":"Benzene Derivatives","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental Monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Industrial Waste","type":1},{"tag":"Toluene","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollutants, Chemical","type":1},{"tag":"Xylenes","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:09:36Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:09:36Z","dateString":"April 2013","dateValue":"2013-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"5CLTIV95","version":1088,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5CLTIV95","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5CLTIV95","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"parsedDate":"2013-02-22","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2011.&#x201D; Federal Register, February 22, 2013. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/02/22/2013-04142/inventory-of-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2011.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"5CLTIV95","version":1088,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2011","creators":[],"abstractNote":"The Draft Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2011 is available for public review.

The federal Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) rules on how drilling activity can take place on federal lands essentially dicate terms, making BLM the largest “regulator” of drilling activity in the country. BLM last revised its oil and gas regulations (the Onshore Orders) in the 1980s and early 1990s, well before the recent rapid expansion of shale gas development. To date there are two rounds of proposed revisions, the first issued in 2012 and the most recent issued in May 2013, after BLM received 177,000 comments on the first round. This paper examines the 2013 proposal in several key respects, including the scope and requirements of the new proposal, the substantial changes from the 2012 proposal, and a comparison of BLM’s proposed rules with rules in states with shale gas development and significant federal land holdings, based on earlier work. We find that BLM’s proposal addresses some apparent gaps in state-level regulation and that, generally, BLM rules do not appear to impose significant requirements beyond existing state regulations, at least across the regulatory elements we analyzed and in those states with large federal land holdings.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2313246","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2313246","accessDate":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T19:08:32Z","dateString":"2013","dateValue":"2013-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"CIMU6ZW3","version":598,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CIMU6ZW3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CIMU6ZW3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Littlefield","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Littlefield, Scott R. &#x201C;Security, Independence, and Sustainability: Imprecise Language and the Manipulation of Energy Policy in the United States.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 52 (2013): 779&#x2013;88.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"CIMU6ZW3","version":598,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Security, independence, and sustainability: Imprecise language and the manipulation of energy policy in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Scott R.","lastName":"Littlefield"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"52","issue":"","pages":"779-788","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z","dateString":"2013","dateValue":"2013-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"C8TAUILA","version":581,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/C8TAUILA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/C8TAUILA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"International Risk Governance Council","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">International Risk Governance Council. <i>Risk Governance Guidelines for Unconventional Gas Development: Report</i>.

It can also serve as a transition fuel that will allow for the shift from coal to renewable energy resources while helping to reduce the emissions of CO2, criteria pollutants, and mercury by the power sector. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. The focus of this Review is on the current understanding of these environmental issues. Drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single well pad allows access to as much as 1 square mile of shale that is located more than a mile below. [Image courtesy of Range Resources Appalachia] Advances The most common problem with well construction is a faulty seal that is emplaced to prevent gas migration into shallow groundwater. The incidence rate of seal problems in unconventional gas wells is relatively low (1 to 3%), but there is a substantial controversy whether the methane detected in private groundwater wells in the area where drilling for unconventional gas is ongoing was caused by well drilling or natural processes. It is difficult to resolve this issue because many areas have long had sources of methane unrelated to hydraulic fracturing, and pre-drilling baseline data are often unavailable. Water management for unconventional shale gas extraction is one of the key issues that will dominate environmental debate surrounding the gas industry. Reuse of produced water for hydraulic fracturing is currently addressing the concerns regarding the vast quantities of contaminants that are brought to the surface. As these well fields mature and the opportunities for wastewater reuse diminish, the need to find alternative management strategies for this wastewater will likely intensify. Outlook Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help effectively manage water-quality risks associated with unconventional gas industry today and in the future. Confidentiality requirements dictated by legal investigations combined with the expedited rate of development and the limited funding for research are major impediments to peer-reviewed research into environmental impacts. Now is the time to work on these environmental issues to avoid an adverse environmental legacy similar to that from abandoned coal mine discharges in Pennsylvania. Hydraulic fracturing, widely known as \"fracking,\" is a relatively inexpensive way to tap into what were previously inaccessible natural gas resources. Vidic et al. (p. 826) review the current status of shale gas development and discuss the possible threats to water resources. In one of the hotbeds of fracking activity, the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States, there is little evidence that additives have directly entered groundwater supplies, but the risk remains. Ensuring access to monitoring data is an important first step toward addressing any public and environmental health concerns. Unconventional natural gas resources offer an opportunity to access a relatively clean fossil fuel that could potentially lead to energy independence for some countries. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. We review the current understanding of environmental issues associated with unconventional gas extra tion. Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help manage these water-quality risks today and in the future.%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/340/6134/1235009.full.pdf","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"340","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.1235009","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED","QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:34Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:34:34Z","dateString":"2013","dateValue":"2013-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"M6ZNIULG","version":531,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M6ZNIULG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M6ZNIULG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bangsund and Hodur","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bangsund, Dean, and Nancy M.

This shift in the energy industry has been accompanied by rising concerns over potential impacts on water resources because producing these fuels is thought to require more water per unit of energy produced than conventional sources and may lead to greater degradation of water quality. In this paper, we address these emerging environmental issues by (a) providing a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the water quantity and quality implications of producing the main unconventional fossil fuels in North America and (b) characterizing the diﬀerences in social costs that arise from the extraction and production of these fuels versus those from conventional fossil fuel production.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2352481","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Water Resources and Unconventional Fossil Fuel Development","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2352481","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED","QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z","dateString":"2013","dateValue":"2013-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"2W8LR52S","version":597,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2W8LR52S","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2W8LR52S","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lewandowski and Wobbekind","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0.4. for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells and >½ mile from wells, respectively. Cumulative cancer risks were 10 in a million and 6 in a million for residents living ≤ ½ mile and >½ mile from wells, respectively, with benzene as the major contributor to the risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk assessment can be used in HIAs to direct health risk prevention strategies. Risk management approaches should focus on reducing exposures to emissions during well completions. These preliminary results indicate that health effects resulting from air emissions during unconventional NGD warrant further study. Prospective studies should focus on health effects associated with air pollution.","publicationTitle":"The Science of the Total Environment","volume":"424","issue":"","pages":"79-87","date":"May 01, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci.

The northeastern U.S., specifically the Allegheny Plateau in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, is experiencing rapid exploration. Using Pennsylvania as a proxy for regional development across the Plateau, we examine land cover change due to shale-gas exploration, with emphasis on forest fragmentation. Pennsylvania’s shale-gas development is greatest on private land, and is dominated by pads with 1–2 wells; less than 10 % of pads have five wells or more. Approximately 45–62 % of pads occur on agricultural land and 38–54 % in forest land (many in core forest on private land). Development of permits granted as of June 3, 2011, would convert at least 644–1072 ha of agricultural land and 536–894 ha of forest land. Agricultural land conversion suggests that drilling is somewhat competing with food production. Accounting for existing pads and development of all permits would result in at least 649 km of new road, which, along with pipelines, would fragment forest cover. The Susquehanna River basin (feeding the Chesapeake Bay), is most developed, with 885 pads (26 % in core forest); permit data suggests the basin will experience continued heavy development. The intensity of core forest disturbance, where many headwater streams occur, suggests that such streams should become a focus of aquatic monitoring. Given the intense development on private lands, we believe a regional strategy is needed to help guide infrastructure development, so that habitat loss, farmland conversion, and the risk to waterways are better managed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Management","volume":"49","issue":"5","pages":"1061-1075","date":"2012/05/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Management","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","ISSN":"0364-152X, 1432-1009","shortTitle":"Early Trends in Landcover Change and Forest Fragmentation Due to Shale-Gas Development in Pennsylvania","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","accessDate":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","dateString":"May 1, 2012","dateValue":"2012-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"84Z253QR","version":529,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/84Z253QR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/84Z253QR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Alvarez et al.","parsedDate":"2012-04-24","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Alvarez, Ram&#xF3;n A., Stephen W.

A modeling study was carried out to assess relative contributions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and individual volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrous acid (HONO) in winter ozone formation episodes in this region. The conditions of two ozone episodes, one in February 2008 and one in March 2011, were represented using a simplified box model with all pollutants present initially, but with the detailed SAPRC-07 chemical mechanism adapted for the temperature and radiation conditions arising from the high surface albedo of the snow that was present. Sensitivity calculations were conducted to assess effects of varying HONO inputs, ambient VOC speciation, and changing treatments of temperature and lighting conditions. The locations modeled were found to be quite different in VOC speciation and sensitivities to VOC and NOx emissions, with one site modeled for the 2008 episode being highly NOx-sensitive and insensitive to VOCs and HONO, and the other 2008 site and both 2011 sites being very sensitive to changes in VOC and HONO inputs. Incremental reactivity scales calculated for VOC-sensitive conditions in the UGRB predict far lower relative contributions of alkanes to ozone formation than in the traditional urban-based MIR scale and that the major contributors to ozone formation were the alkenes and the aromatics, despite their relatively small mass contributions. The reactivity scales are affected by the variable ambient VOC speciation and uncertainties in ambient HONO levels. These box model calculations are useful for indicating general sensitivities and reactivity characteristics of these winter UGRB episodes, but fully three-dimensional models will be required to assess ozone abatement strategies in the UGRB.","publicationTitle":"Atmospheric Environment","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"255-266","date":"April 1, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Atmospheric Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.12.025","ISSN":"1352-2310","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011012982","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Incremental VOC reactivity","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas production","type":1},{"tag":"SAPRC-07 mechanism","type":1},{"tag":"Upper Green River Basin","type":1},{"tag":"Winter ozone","type":1}],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z","dateString":"April 1, 2012","dateValue":"2012-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"EBNPMJQD","version":1331,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EBNPMJQD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EBNPMJQD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wiseman","parsedDate":"2012-04-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Wiseman, Hannah. &#x201C;Fracturing Regulation Applied.&#x201D; <i>Duke Environmental Law &amp; Policy Forum</i> 22, no. 2 (April 1, 2012): 361&#x2013;84. https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/delpf/vol22/iss2/5.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"EBNPMJQD","version":1331,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fracturing Regulation Applied","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hannah","lastName":"Wiseman"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Duke Environmental Law & Policy Forum","volume":"22","issue":"2","pages":"361-384","date":"2012-04-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"1064-3958","shortTitle":"","url":"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/delpf/vol22/iss2/5","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:16:56Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:16:56Z","dateString":"April 1, 2012","dateValue":"2012-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"AS4PALJS","version":598,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AS4PALJS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AS4PALJS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lu et al.","parsedDate":"2012-03-06","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lu, Xi, Jackson Salovaara, and Michael B.

To further characterize the emissions of methane and non?methane hydrocarbons (propane, n?butane, i?pentane, n?pentane and benzene) around BAO, a pilot study involving automobile?based surveys was carried out during the summer of 2008. A mix of venting emissions (leaks) of raw natural gas and flashing emissions from condensate storage tanks can explain the alkane ratios we observe in air masses impacted by oil and gas operations in northeastern Colorado. Using the WRAP Phase III inventory of total volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and gas exploration, production and processing, together with flashing and venting emission speciation profiles provided by State agencies or the oil and gas industry, we derive a range of bottom?up speciated emissions for Weld County in 2008. We use the observed ambient molar ratios and flashing and venting emissions data to calculate top?down scenarios for the amount of natural gas leaked to the atmosphere and the associated methane and non?methane emissions. Our analysis suggests that the emissions of the species we measured are most likely underestimated in current inventories and that the uncertainties attached to these estimates can be as high as a factor of two.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"117","issue":"D4","pages":"","date":"February 21, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","language":"","DOI":"10.1029/2011JD016360","ISSN":"0148-0227","shortTitle":"Hydrocarbon emissions characterization in the Colorado Front Range","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011JD016360","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"NOAA","type":1},{"tag":"alkanes","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric measurements","type":1},{"tag":"benzene","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK","FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","dateString":"February 21, 2012","dateValue":"2012-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"5A5KJKYZ","version":831,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5A5KJKYZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5A5KJKYZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"parsedDate":"2012-01-20","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Shale Gas: A Renaissance In U.S. Manufacturing?&#x201D; Manufacturing.net, January 20, 2012. https://www.manufacturing.net/article/2012/01/shale-gas-renaissance-us-manufacturing.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"5A5KJKYZ","version":831,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Shale Gas: A Renaissance In U.S. Manufacturing?","creators":[],"abstractNote":"The relatively inexpensive and stable long-term source of natural gas is helping manufacturing companies expand and open more facilities in the U.S.","websiteTitle":"Manufacturing.net","websiteType":"","date":"2012-01-20T12:29:50-05:00","shortTitle":"Shale Gas","url":"https://www.manufacturing.net/article/2012/01/shale-gas-renaissance-us-manufacturing","accessDate":"2018-04-26T15:06:37Z","language":"en","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-26T15:06:37Z","dateModified":"2018-04-26T15:06:37Z","dateString":"January 20, 2012","dateValue":"2012-01-20T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"VZUAPC4F","version":707,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VZUAPC4F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VZUAPC4F","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"parsedDate":"2012-01-19","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Shale Gas: New Opportunities, New Challenges.&#x201D; Bipartisan Policy Center, January 19, 2012. https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/shale-gas-new-opportunities-new-challenges/.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"VZUAPC4F","version":707,"itemType":"blogPost","title":"Shale Gas: New Opportunities, New Challenges","creators":[],"abstractNote":"The outlook for North America’s natural gas supply has improved dramatically in recent years as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies have made it possible to commercially develop tight and shale gas reserves.

While there is much enthusiasm surrounding the benefits from this source of energy as a potential path to energy independence, very little is known about the environmental risks associated with this exploration activity. In this paper, we present one of the first empirical studies to measure the impact of early shale exploration as capitalized into surrounding property values. Our dataset combines real estate data, shale well data and land use data in Washington County, Pennsylvania from 2008 to mid-2010 to estimate the impact of shale activity on nearby housing values using a Box-Cox hedonic specification. We find that households are adversely impacted by shale gas exploration activity, but this impact depends on the proximity and intensity of shale activity and is largely transitory in duration. While the magnitude of the overall effect of an additional shale well within one mile from the property is modest (-0.8%) this impact is heterogeneous. The effect is larger for households located close to major highways and sourced with private well water. The impacts are larger and more persistent for properties surrounded by agricultural lands.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2117932","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Is the Shale Boom a Bust for Nearby Residents?","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2117932","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","dateString":"2012","dateValue":"2012-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"95HKIN55","version":988,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/95HKIN55","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/95HKIN55","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sharp and Allayaud","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Here we assess the level of GHG emissions from shale gas well hydraulic fracturing operations in the United States during 2010. Data from each of the approximately 4000 horizontal shale gas wells brought online that year are used to show that about 900 Gg CH 4 of potential fugitive emissions were generated by these operations, or 228 Mg CH 4 per well—a figure inappropriately used in analyses of the GHG impact of shale gas. In fact, along with simply venting gas produced during the completion of shale gas wells, two additional techniques are widely used to handle these potential emissions: gas flaring and reduced emission ‘green’ completions. The use of flaring and reduced emission completions reduce the levels of actual fugitive emissions from shale well completion operations to about 216 Gg CH 4 , or 50 Mg CH 4 per well, a release substantially lower than several widely quoted estimates. Although fugitive emissions from the overall natural gas sector are a proper concern, it is incorrect to suggest that shale gas-related hydraulic fracturing has substantially altered the overall GHG intensity of natural gas production.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"044030","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This report responds to a discovery of potentially massive deposits beneath the Marcellus Shale and a series of related issues concerning the economy, environmental protection, and public safety. The findings are drawn from an October 2011 telephone survey conducted by the Muhlenberg Institute of Public Opinion, in collaboration with the University of Michigan Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy. This survey secured responses from 525 residents of the state, drawn from all regions and comprising a statistically-representative profile of citizens. It examines general public attitudes on this issue as well as consideration of a series of policy options that have been introduced in state and local government circles.","reportNumber":"ID 2313288","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2011/11/01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Fracking for Natural Gas","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2313288","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"CLOSUP","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"climate change","type":1},{"tag":"energy","type":1},{"tag":"environment","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"national surveys on energy and environment","type":1},{"tag":"survey","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z","dateString":"November 1, 2011","dateValue":"2011-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KM38QWEE","version":1229,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KM38QWEE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KM38QWEE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wiseman and Gradijan","parsedDate":"2011-10-31","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Wiseman, Hannah Jacobs, and Francis Gradijan. &#x201C;Regulation of Shale Gas Development, Including Hydraulic Fracturing.&#x201D; SSRN Scholarly Paper.

It identifies and compares the environmental laws and regulations that apply to most stages of the oil or gas development process in shales and tight sands, from conducting seismic testing to constructing a well pad, drilling, withdrawing water, completing a hydraulic fracture treatment, and storing and disposing of waste. It briefly describes municipal ordinances and federal regulations, including recently-announced EPA regulatory efforts, but focuses primarily on the states, comparing regulations in sixteen states.  The paper's comparison tables show that state regulations in some areas vary substantially, and the paper attempts to connect the potential risks of oil and gas development from shales and tight sands -- which are addressed in another Energy Institute paper by Professor Ian Duncan -- to the regulation. The paper concludes that states should modify certain regulations to address these risks. Some states do not require specific types of blowout prevention, for example, offering only a narrative standard, yet well blowouts are an important concern at the drilling and fracturing stage. States also should update their casing and cementing regulations to protect well integrity during drilling and fracturing and ensure long-term well integrity, and they should require the testing of water around proposed wells before site construction begins.  Ideally, states also would consider implementing a presumption of oil and gas operator liability for water well contamination, as Pennsylvania and West Virginia have done. For risks at the well surface, states should update spill prevention requirements at well sites and consider whether federal Department of Transportation regulations addressing the movement of fracturing chemicals adequately protect against spills. States also must explore better options for disposing of large quantities of new wastes and regulating the withdrawal of large volumes of water for fracturing to prevent adverse impacts to streams and overuse of underground sources of water. Further, states and the federal government must enhance air quality monitoring around sites and consider additional controls. Finally, the collection of more and better data, including information from baseline and post-production water testing, is essential. With states at the regulatory helm, comparison of public law strategies to address development risks can produce fruitful cross-jurisdictional lessons.    The Energy Institute at the University of Texas funded the research for this paper.","reportNumber":"ID 1953547","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2011/10/31","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1953547","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:19:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"environmental","type":1},{"tag":"federal regulation","type":1},{"tag":"fracing","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"fracking law","type":1},{"tag":"fracking regulation","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"hydrofracking","type":1},{"tag":"hyrdofracture","type":1},{"tag":"law","type":1},{"tag":"municipal regulation","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas law","type":1},{"tag":"regulation","type":1},{"tag":"regulation of hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"risk","type":1},{"tag":"state regulations","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:19:39Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:19:39Z","dateString":"October 31, 2011","dateValue":"2011-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"IYJY4YAS","version":773,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IYJY4YAS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IYJY4YAS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Entrekin Sally et al.","parsedDate":"2011-10-06","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Entrekin Sally, Evans-White Michelle, Johnson Brent, and Hagenbuch Elisabeth. &#x201C;Rapid Expansion of Natural Gas Development Poses a Threat to Surface Waters.&#x201D; <i>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</i> 9, no. 9 (October 6, 2011): 503&#x2013;11. https://doi.org/10.1890/110053.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IYJY4YAS","version":773,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Rapid expansion of natural gas development poses a threat to surface waters","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Entrekin Sally"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Evans-White Michelle"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Johnson Brent"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Hagenbuch Elisabeth"}],"abstractNote":"Extraction of natural gas from hard?to?reach reservoirs has expanded around the world and poses multiple environmental threats to surface waters. Improved drilling and extraction technology used to access low permeability natural gas requires millions of liters of water and a suite of chemicals that may be toxic to aquatic biota. There is growing concern among the scientific community and the general public that rapid and extensive natural gas development in the US could lead to degradation of natural resources. Gas wells are often close to surface waters that could be impacted by elevated sediment runoff from pipelines and roads, alteration of streamflow as a result of water extraction, and contamination from introduced chemicals or the resulting wastewater. However, the data required to fully understand these potential threats are currently lacking. Scientists therefore need to study the changes in ecosystem structure and function caused by natural gas extraction and to use such data to inform sound environmental policy.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","volume":"9","issue":"9","pages":"503-511","date":"October 6, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1890/110053","ISSN":"1540-9295","shortTitle":"","url":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/110053","accessDate":"2018-04-20T17:37:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-20T17:37:04Z","dateModified":"2018-04-20T17:37:04Z","dateString":"October 6, 2011","dateValue":"2011-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"J7G79HIN","version":1076,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/J7G79HIN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/J7G79HIN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wigley","parsedDate":"2011-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Wigley, Tom M.

Gas produces approximately half the amount of CO2 per unit of primary energy compared with coal. Here we consider a scenario where a fraction of coal usage is replaced by natural gas (i.e., methane, CH4) over a given time period, and where a percentage of the gas production is assumed to leak into the atmosphere. The additional CH4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO2 emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"108","issue":"3","pages":"601","date":"2011/10/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0217-3","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"Coal to gas","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0217-3","accessDate":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z","dateString":"October 1, 2011","dateValue":"2011-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"FB92XS3M","version":1571,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FB92XS3M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FB92XS3M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Colborn et al.","parsedDate":"2011-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Colborn, Theo, Carol Kwiatkowski, Kim Schultz, and Mary Bachran. &#x201C;Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective.&#x201D; <i>Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal</i> 17, no. 5 (September 1, 2011): 1039&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FB92XS3M","version":1571,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Colborn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carol","lastName":"Kwiatkowski"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Schultz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Bachran"}],"abstractNote":"The technology to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and amounts of toxic chemicals. A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas operations was compiled. Literature searches were conducted to determine potential health effects of the 353 chemicals identified by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers. More than 75% of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Approximately 40–50% could affect the brain/nervous system, immune and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys; 37% could affect the endocrine system; and 25% could cause cancer and mutations. These results indicate that many chemicals used during the fracturing and drilling stages of gas operations may have long-term health effects that are not immediately expressed. In addition, an example was provided of waste evaporation pit residuals that contained numerous chemicals on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) lists of hazardous substances. The discussion highlights the difficulty of developing effective water quality monitoring programs. To protect public health we recommend full disclosure of the contents of all products, extensive air and water monitoring, coordinated environmental/human health studies, and regulation of fracturing under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act.","publicationTitle":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal","volume":"17","issue":"5","pages":"1039-1056","date":"September 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","ISSN":"1080-7039","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","accessDate":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"drilling","type":1},{"tag":"health","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"ozone","type":1},{"tag":"pollution","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC","UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z","dateString":"September 1, 2011","dateValue":"2011-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"QU3MS335","version":915,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QU3MS335","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QU3MS335","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Alley et al.","parsedDate":"2011-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Alley, Bethany, Alex Beebe, John Rodgers, and James W.

A meta-analysis of characteristics of five PW sources [i.e. shale gas (SGPWs), conventional natural gas (NGPWs), conventional oil (OPWs), coal-bed methane (CBMPWs), tight gas sands (TGSPWs)] was conducted from peer-reviewed literature, government or industry documents, book chapters, internet sources, analytical records from industry, and analyses of PW samples. This meta-analysis assembled a large dataset to extract information of interest such as differences and similarities in constituent and constituent concentrations across these sources of PWs. The PW data analyzed were comprised of 377 coal-bed methane, 165 oilfield, 137 tight gas sand, 4000 natural gas, and 541 shale gas records. Majority of SGPWs, NGPWs, OPWs, and TGSPWs contain chloride concentrations ranging from saline (>30000mgL−1) to hypersaline (>40000mgL−1), while most CBMPWs were fresh (<5000mgL−1). For inorganic constituents, most SGPW and NGPW iron concentrations exceeded the numeric criterion for irrigation and surface water discharge, while OPW and CBMPW iron concentrations were less than the criterion. Approximately one-fourth of the PW samples in this database are fresh and likely need minimal treatment for metal and metalloid constituents prior to use, while some PWs are brackish (5000–30000mgCl−L−1) to saline containing metals and metalloids that may require considerable treatment. Other PWs are hypersaline and produce a considerable waste stream from reverse osmosis; remediation of these waters may not be feasible. After renovation, fresh to saline PWs may be used for irrigation and replenishing surface waters.","publicationTitle":"Chemosphere","volume":"85","issue":"1","pages":"74-82","date":"September 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Chemosphere","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.05.043","ISSN":"0045-6535","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653511005960","accessDate":"2018-05-01T20:02:16Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Beneficial use","type":1},{"tag":"Coal-bed methane produced waters","type":1},{"tag":"Conventional natural gas produced waters","type":1},{"tag":"Conventional oil produced waters","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas produced waters","type":1},{"tag":"Tight gas sands produced waters","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T20:02:17Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T20:02:17Z","dateString":"September 1, 2011","dateValue":"2011-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7BE7ZSXQ","version":899,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7BE7ZSXQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7BE7ZSXQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jiang et al.","parsedDate":"2011-07-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jiang, Mohan, W Michael Griffin, Chris Hendrickson, Paulina Jaramillo, Jeanne VanBriesen, and Aranya Venkatesh. &#x201C;Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Marcellus Shale Gas.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Research Letters</i> 6, no. 3 (July 1, 2011): 034014. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7BE7ZSXQ","version":899,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of Marcellus shale gas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohan","lastName":"Jiang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"W","lastName":"Michael Griffin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Hendrickson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Paulina","lastName":"Jaramillo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeanne","lastName":"VanBriesen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aranya","lastName":"Venkatesh"}],"abstractNote":"This study estimates the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production of Marcellus shale natural gas and compares its emissions with national average US natural gas emissions produced in the year 2008, prior to any signiﬁcant Marcellus shale development.

This represents an 11% increase in GHG emissions relative to average domestic gas (excluding combustion) and a 3% increase relative to the life cycle emissions when combustion is included. The life cycle GHG emissions of Marcellus shale natural gas are estimated to be 63–75 g CO2e/MJ of gas produced with an average of 68 g CO2e/MJ of gas produced. Marcellus shale natural gas GHG emissions are comparable to those of imported liqueﬁed natural gas.

Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured—as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids—and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"106","issue":"4","pages":"679","date":"2011/06/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","dateString":"June 1, 2011","dateValue":"2011-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"G5L4AKEF","version":411,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/G5L4AKEF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/G5L4AKEF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gregory et al.","parsedDate":"2011-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gregory, Kelvin B., Radisav D.

In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH4 L-1 (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L-1 (P < 0.05; n = 34). Average δ13C-CH4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P < 0.0001). These δ13C-CH4 data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and δ2H-CH4 values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and—possibly—regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"108","issue":"20","pages":"8172-8176","date":"2011/05/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1100682108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/20/8172","accessDate":"2018-04-26T14:55:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

This study seeks to fill a critical information gap on the impact of gas drilling and extraction from Marcellus Shale deposits deep underground: an assessment of the economic impacts – emphasizing the direct economic impact, rather than just focusing on the perceived benefits and impacts affecting the region. Our analysis is based on extensive field research, including a site visit and interviews with industry participants. It is further cross-validated by examining similar costs for development of Marcellus Wells by a vertically-integrated exploration and production firm.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2181675","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2181675","accessDate":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z","dateString":"2011","dateValue":"2011-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":606,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Michaels","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Michaels, Guy. &#x201C;The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation.&#x201D; <i>The Economic Journal</i> 121 (2011): 31&#x2013;57. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":606,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Michaels"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"The Economic Journal","volume":"121","issue":"","pages":"31-57","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x","ISSN":"1468-0297","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:24:21Z","dateString":"2011","dateValue":"2011-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"WYEHD5NE","version":285,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WYEHD5NE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WYEHD5NE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yergin","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yergin, Daniel. <i>The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World</i>.

The US Energy Information Administration projects that unconventional gas will supply nearly half of US gas production by 2035. In addition, by significantly expanding and diversifying the gas supply internationally, the exploitation of new unconventional gas resources has the potential to reshape energy policy at national and international levels—altering geopolitics and energy security, recasting the economics of energy technology investment decisions, and shifting trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In anticipation of this expansion, one of the perceived core advantages of unconventional gas—its relatively moderate GHG impact compared to coal—has recently come under scrutiny. In this paper, we compare the GHG footprints of conventional natural gas, unconventional natural gas (i.e. shale gas that has been produced using the process of hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking'), and coal in a transparent and consistent way, focusing primarily on the electricity generation sector. We show that for electricity generation the GHG impacts of shale gas are 11% higher than those of conventional gas, and only 56% that of coal for standard assumptions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"6","issue":"4","pages":"044008","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Such a development raises expectations that U.S. energy consumption will shift toward natural gas. To examine how the apparent abundance of natural gas and projected growth of its use might affect natural gas prices, production, and consumption, we use NEMS-RFF to model a number of scenarios—reflecting different perspectives on natural gas availability, the availability of competing resources, demand for natural gas, and climate policy—through 2030. We find that more abundant shale gas resources create an environment in which natural gas prices are likely to remain attractive to consumers—even as policy advances additional uses of natural gas to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and bolster energy security.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2010","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.1666996","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Abundant Shale Gas Resources","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1666996","accessDate":"2018-04-12T20:01:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-12T20:01:09Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T20:01:09Z","dateString":"2010","dateValue":"2010-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"5B5ZM2JP","version":268,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5B5ZM2JP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5B5ZM2JP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"International Monetary Fund","parsedDate":"2010","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">International Monetary Fund. <i>The Taxation of Petroleum and Minerals: Principles, Problems and Practice</i>.

Photochemical ozone production near the Earth’s surface is considered a summertime, urban phenomenon1,2,3, where hourly average ozone concentrations can exceed 150 p.p.b., compared with background values of about 50 p.p.b., and wintertime ozone concentrations in the US are usually in the range of 35–50 p.p.b. (refs 1, 2, 3). Here we report rapid, diurnal photochemical production of ozone during air temperatures as low as −17 ∘C, in the rural Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, in the vicinity of the Jonah–Pinedale Anticline natural gas field. We find that hourly average ozone concentrations rise from 10–30 p.p.b. at night to more than 140 p.p.b. shortly after solar noon, under the influence of a stagnant, high-pressure system that promotes cold temperatures, low wind speeds and limited cloudiness. Under these conditions, an intense, shallow temperature inversion develops in the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere, which traps high concentrations of ozone precursors at night. During daytime, photolytic ozone production then leads to the observed high concentrations. We suggest that similar ozone production during wintertime is probably occurring around the world under comparable industrial and meteorological conditions.","publicationTitle":"Nature Geoscience","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"120-122","date":"2009-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/ngeo415","ISSN":"1752-0908","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo415","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2009 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","dateString":"February 2009","dateValue":"2009-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GN68HBPK","version":584,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GN68HBPK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GN68HBPK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jacquet","parsedDate":"2009","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

This article illustrates how countries dependent on point source natural resources (those extracted from a narrow geographic or economic base, such as oil and minerals) and plantation crops are predisposed to heightened economic and social divisions and weakened institutional capacity. This in turn impedes their ability to respond effectively to shocks, which previous studies have shown to be essential for sustaining rising levels of prosperity. Analysis of data on classifications of export structure, controlling for a wide array of other potential determinants of governance, shows that point source– and coffee and cocoa–exporting countries do relatively poorly across an array of governance indicators. These governance effects are not associated simply with being a natural resource exporter. Countries with natural resource exports that are diffuse—relying primarily on livestock and agricultural produce from small family farms—do not show the same strong effects—and have had more robust growth recoveries.","publicationTitle":"The World Bank Economic Review","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"141-174","date":"January 1, 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/wber/lhi010","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Varieties of Resource Experience: Natural Resource Export Structures and the Political Economy of Economic Growth","url":"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/141.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 1, 2005","dateValue":"2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"8B6EFQ2Q","version":592,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8B6EFQ2Q","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8B6EFQ2Q","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kunce and Morgan","parsedDate":"2005","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kunce, Mitch, and William E.

Despite access to potable well water, the poisoned ewes willingly consumed toxic doses of condensate that contaminated surface water. Eight animals died without premonitory signs; the remainder became ill over the course of a few days to 3 weeks. The principal cause of mortality was aspiration pneumonia, but myocardial degeneration and necrosis, renal tubular damage, gastritis, enteritis, and meningeal edema and hyperemia were also observed. Gas chromatographic analysis identified chemical traces of the hydrocarbons in the tissues, and \"fingerprinting,\" the process of matching chromatographic tracings, provided forensic proof of the contamination source. Atomic absorption spectroscopy and cholinesterase analyses were performed to eliminate the possibility of toxicosis by heavy metal contaminants or other constituents. This appears to be the first reported incidence of natural gas condensate toxicity involving sheep or other ruminants. Although the available literature presents a suggestive pattern of clinical signs and pathologic lesions of petroleum product poisoning, diagnostic investigations should employ detailed analytic examination because each source of petroleum hydrocarbons contains unique sets of components that may produce different toxic effects.","publicationTitle":"Veterinary Pathology","volume":"29","issue":"1","pages":"11-20","date":"Jan 1992","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Vet.

Introduction From 1962 until 1966, waste fluids were injected into the pre-Cambrian formations northwest of Denver, Colo. Since injection started into the 12,000-ft well, earthquakes have been observed in the area. This seismic activity, although different in character, continued when injection was stopped. Consideration has been given to removal of the waste fluids from the well to reduce earthquake magnitude and frequency. This article is a case history of the well, its operation, the observed earthquakes, and a discussion of possible mechanisms. Considerable information is available in various reports. See the references for more detailed information than can be given here. Drilling and Completion The Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) disposed of waste waters by various means until 1961, when the deep waste disposal well was completed. Before the well was completed eight geologic formations were considered as possible injection reservoirs: the Hygiene sandstone, the Codell sandstone, the \"J\" sandstone, the Dakota sandstone, the Morrison formation, the Lyons formation and the Fountain formation. The hole was to be drilled to a total depth to penetrate the pre-Cambrian rocks. pre-Cambrian rocks. During drilling it was found that the potential reservoirs were tightly cemented with silica and that Cambrian was then considered as a disposal prospect. Waste disposal through wells is practiced in many states. The RMA disposal well is unique in that it is by far the deepest (12,000 ft) and in that the reservoir consists of fractures in crystalline rock as opposed to sedimentary rocks in other projects. Operating conditions of the well fall within the range of all wells. The maximum wellhead injection pressure for the RMA well was 1,100 psi during an injection rate of 300 gal/min. The greatest depth of other waste disposal wells is 7,650 ft; the maximum wellhead pressure is 400 psi, and the maximum injection rate is 700 gal/ min. During the drilling of the well, lost circulation was observed in the Lyons formation (9,582 to 9,772 ft). Eight instances of mud losses were noted. These ranged from a 10- to a 320-bbl loss. Cores indicated the formation to be fractured. The Fountain formation (9,772 to 11,880 ft) appeared to be highly fractured to a depth of 10,400 ft, with some fracturing at greater depths. Lost circulation was frequently experienced while drilling through the Fountain, mostly between 9,960 and 10,250 ft. The lowest mud loss took place at 11,080 and was the most serious one in the well, with some 1,350 bbl lost. The well was cased to 11,171 ft and subsequent drilling did not encounter lost circulation until after a core was cut in the pre-Cambrian (11,950 ft total depth).

Here we assess whether it is plausible that human activity caused these earthquakes. Analysis of both lake and groundwater variations near Azle shows that no significant stress changes were associated with the shallow water table before or during the earthquake sequence. In contrast, pore-pressure models demonstrate that a combination of brine production and wastewater injection near the fault generated subsurface pressures sufficient to induce earthquakes on near-critically stressed faults. On the basis of modelling results and the absence of historical earthquakes near Azle, brine production combined with wastewater disposal represent the most likely cause of recent seismicity near Azle. For assessing the earthquake cause, our research underscores the necessity of monitoring subsurface wastewater formation pressures and monitoring earthquakes having magnitudes of [sim]M2 and greater. Currently, monitoring at these levels is not standard across Texas or the United States.","publicationTitle":"Nat Commun","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"","date":"04/21/online 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms7728","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:27Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:27Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"BKYM8WTX","version":597,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BKYM8WTX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BKYM8WTX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Leighty and Lin","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Leighty, Wayne, and C.

The measurements were carried out in July and August 2014 as part of NASA's “Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality” (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaign. The PTR-QMS data were supported by pressurized whole air canister samples and airborne vertical and horizontal surveys of VOCs. Unexpectedly high benzene mixing ratios were observed at PAO at ground level (mean benzene = 0.53 ppbv, maximum benzene = 29.3 ppbv), primarily at night (mean nighttime benzene = 0.73 ppbv). These high benzene levels were associated with southwesterly winds. The airborne measurements indicate that benzene originated from within the WGF, and typical source signatures detected in the canister samples implicate emissions from O&NG activities rather than urban vehicular emissions as primary benzene source. This conclusion is backed by a regional toluene-to-benzene ratio analysis which associated southerly flow with vehicular emissions from the Denver area. Weak benzene-to-CO correlations confirmed that traffic emissions were not responsible for the observed high benzene levels. Previous measurements at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) and our data obtained at PAO allow us to locate the source of benzene enhancements between the two atmospheric observatories. Fugitive emissions of benzene from O&NG operations in the Platteville area are discussed as the most likely causes of enhanced benzene levels at PAO.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"121","issue":"18","pages":"11,055-11,074","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016JD025327","ISSN":"2169-8996","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JD025327","accessDate":"2018-07-11T18:03:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2016.

In situ air quality measurements using membrane inlet mobile mass spectrometry revealed ambient benzene and toluene concentrations as high as 1000 and 5000 parts-per-billion, respectively, originating from specific sub-processes on unconventional oil and gas well pad sites. The detection of highly variant contamination events attributable to natural gas flaring units, condensate tanks, compressor units, and hydrogen sulfide scavengers indicates that mechanical inefficiencies, and not necessarily the inherent nature of the extraction process as a whole, result in the release of these compounds into the environment. This awareness of ongoing contamination events contributes to an enhanced knowledge of ambient volatile organic compounds on a regional scale. While these reconnaissance measurements on their own do not fully characterize the fluctuations of ambient BTEX concentrations that likely exist in the atmosphere of the Eagle Ford Shale region, they do suggest that contamination events from unconventional oil and gas development can be monitored, controlled, and reduced.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"573","issue":"","pages":"382-388","date":"12/15/ 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.118","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air quality"},{"tag":"BTEX"},{"tag":"Eagle Ford"},{"tag":"Mobile mass spectrometry"}],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"7RLFMT7L","version":806,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7RLFMT7L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7RLFMT7L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Krupnick, Alan J. &#x201C;Will Natural Gas Vehicles Be in Our Future?,&#x201D; n.d., 5.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7RLFMT7L","version":806,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Will Natural Gas Vehicles Be in Our Future?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alan J","lastName":"Krupnick"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"5","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-26T14:23:29Z","dateModified":"2018-04-26T14:23:29Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"GBSIHFG2","version":809,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GBSIHFG2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GBSIHFG2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Trouble With Health Near Gas Fracking.&#x201D; NPR.org.

The data sources and approach used in this study differ significantly from previous efforts. The authors used inventories from the year 2009 tracking emissions of regulated air pollutants by the natural gas industry in the Barnett Shale play. These inventories were collected and screened by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). These data cover the characteristics and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of more than 16,000 individual sources in shale gas production and processing. Translating estimated emissions of VOCs into estimates of methane and carbon dioxide emissions was accomplished through the novel compilation of spatially heterogeneous gas composition analyses. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generated from Barnett Shale gas extracted in 2009 were found to be very similar to conventional natural gas and less than half those of coal-fired electricity generation.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Unconventional Oil and Gas Resources","volume":"8","issue":"","pages":"46-55","date":"12// 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juogr.2014.07.002","ISSN":"2213-3976","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment (LCA)"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Power: methane leakage"}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:22Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:22Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"H2Y5QUA8","version":830,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H2Y5QUA8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H2Y5QUA8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

The rapid deployment of fracking has been accompanied by concerns about negative externalities. In response, a regulatory regime has emerged that requires disclosure of chemical additives, but preserves a loophole by which ﬁrms can claim that such disclosure imperils “trade secrets.” To shed light on the importance of such a disclosure rule, we combine data from wells drilled in two signiﬁcant gas ﬁelds in Wyoming with disclosure data from FracFocus about injected chemicals and materials. We explore the relation between toxicity of injectants, tendency to use the trade secrets shield, and identity of the well operator and the service company that performed the frac job. Our results have implications for the impact on social net beneﬁts of the recently reported merger between two major service companies.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"40","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:06:11Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:06:11Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"9MVC4DBW","version":843,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9MVC4DBW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9MVC4DBW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Boudet et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Boudet, Hilary S., Chad M.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the “Not in My Backyard” (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity—respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent's location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age.

Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&amp;G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&amp;G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&amp;G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (&gt; 80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&amp;G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&amp;G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"576","issue":"","pages":"138-147","date":"1/15/ 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.072","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air pollution"},{"tag":"Carcinogens"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Shale"},{"tag":"Wastewater"},{"tag":"Water contamination"}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:10Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"I2M833WB","version":918,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/I2M833WB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/I2M833WB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Waxman et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Our study area consists of two counties in Pennsylvania that are home to large amounts of unconventional natural gas extraction but are otherwise isolated from other resource extraction industries or large urban areas. We deploy parametric, semi-parametric, and matching hedonic regression models that include recent quasi-experimental methods and, in contrast to previous research and much popular intuition, we fail to find robust significance that negative environmental externalities of natural gas extraction are manifested in nearby property values.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), residents of Pavillion petitioned EPA, asking the agency to investigate whether groundwater contamination exists, its extent, and possible sources. Following the petition, EPA began its investigation three years ago. Although the final report may contain revised or more specific conclusions, the draft report indicated that EPA had identified certain constituents in groundwater above the production zone of the Pavillion natural gas wells that are consistent with some of the constituents used in natural gas well operations, including the process of hydraulic fracturing. In its report, EPA claimed that its approach to the investigation best supports the explanation that inorganic and organic compounds associated with hydraulic fracturing have contaminated the aquifer at or below the depths used for domestic water supply in the Pavillion area. EPA also stated that its approach indicates that gas production activities have likely enhanced the migration of natural gas in the aquifer and the migration of gas to domestic wells in the area. EPA did not appear to conclude that there was a definitive link to a release from the production wells, nor to the constituents found in domestic wells in shallower parts of the aquifer.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"24","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T20:17:24Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T20:17:24Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"HWAMNGHM","version":939,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HWAMNGHM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HWAMNGHM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state’s economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework. It was determined that the oil boom, as represented by the number of rigs in the state, led to an increase in employment and wages in energy sector, as expected, but also in the rest of the economy. Oil development activity had no significant impact on agricultural wages. Both energy sector equations, employment and wage, suggest relative independence of these variables from the movements in agriculture and the rest of the economy, and being impacted mostly by the changes in energy sector itself. Seasonality does not play significant role in energy sector employment and wages unlike in agriculture and the rest of the economy.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.10.007","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Dutch disease"},{"tag":"employment"},{"tag":"energy boom"},{"tag":"labor market"},{"tag":"natural resource curse"},{"tag":"oil"},{"tag":"wages"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"84LC3T83","version":960,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/84LC3T83","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/84LC3T83","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

For counties in the south-central U.S., I ﬁnd little evidence of an emerging curse from greater natural gas production in the 2000s. Each gas-related mining job created more than one nonmining job, indicating that counties did not become more dependent on mining as measured by employment. Increases in population largely mitigated a rise in earnings per job and crowding out. Furthermore, changes in the adult population by education level reveal that greater production did not lead to a less educated population.

I examine the impact of the energy boom on the labor market by exploiting a natural experiment in the Marcellus region. In particular, I compare counties with fracking activity in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the control group of counties in New York, which imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking. I look at how the benefits to the labor demand shock are shared between industries as well as how employment and wages in related industries adjust over the course of the resource boom. The results suggest total employment and wages per job increase by 7% and 11% respectively above pre-boom levels in the three years after the boom, but decline after 4 years or more. The results also show significant positive spillovers to related sectors, such as construction, transportation, retail trade and accommodations. However, there is no evidence of the so called ‘resource curse’ crowding out employment or increasing wages in manufacturing.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.03.004","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Dutch Disease"},{"tag":"Marcellus shale"},{"tag":"labor market"},{"tag":"natural experiment"},{"tag":"panel data"},{"tag":"resource extraction"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"Z6QFHIQ6","version":545,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z6QFHIQ6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z6QFHIQ6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Clarke et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Clarke, Christopher E., Dylan Bugden, P.

We extend this research by examining how geographic proximity to such extraction interacts with political ideology to influence issue support. Regression analysis of data from a fall 2013 national telephone survey of United States residents reveals that as respondents’ geographic distance from areas experiencing significant development increases, political ideology becomes more strongly associated with issue support, with the liberal-partisan divide widening. Our findings support construal level theory's central premise: that people use more abstract considerations (like political ideology) the more geographically removed they are from an issue.

This paper investigates the regional economic impact of shale gas development. The border of New York and Pennsylvania provides a natural experiment for its economic impact because of the moratorium on fracking in NY and the supportive fracking regulations in PA. Using BLS data from 2001-2013, results show that shale gas development has a statistically significant impact at the industry level, but not across the entire economy.

In New York and Pennsylvania, the public debate about the prospect or continuation of high volume hydraulic fracturing for shale gas has revolved around its environmental impacts, particularly its effects on water quality, while taking as a given that exploitation of this new natural gas asset will produce significant economic benefits for the states’ economies. If we want to understand how this new kind of natural gas drilling will affect communities in Pennsylvania and New York, the economic impact models that have been used to project potential benefits and job creation give us only a fraction of the information we need. To fully assess the economic effects, policy makers and citizens need to understand what will drive the pace and scale of drilling and the associated boom-bust cycle. This cycle will have implications for jobs, revenues, the cumulative impact of shale gas development, and the longer-term economic development prospects for drilling regions within the Marcellus Shale area.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"34","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"WIW6QLN5","version":982,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WIW6QLN5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WIW6QLN5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Underground Injection Control 101: EPA&#x2019;s Approach to Developing Permitting Guidance for Hydraulic Fracturing Using Diesel Fuels Webinar for Tribal Representatives,&#x201D; n.d., 28.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WIW6QLN5","version":982,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Underground Injection Control 101: EPA's Approach to Developing Permitting Guidance for Hydraulic Fracturing Using Diesel Fuels Webinar for Tribal Representatives","creators":[],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"28","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-03T13:25:16Z","dateModified":"2018-05-03T13:25:16Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"5FHCSL38","version":986,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5FHCSL38","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5FHCSL38","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Cracks in the Fa&#xE7;ade: 25 Years Ago, EPA Linked &#x2018;Fracking&#x2019; to Water Contamination.&#x201D; Accessed May 3, 2018. http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/fracking/cracks_in_the_facade.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"5FHCSL38","version":986,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Cracks in the Façade: 25 Years Ago, EPA Linked \"Fracking\" to Water Contamination","accessDate":"2018-05-03T13:29:02Z","url":"http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/fracking/cracks_in_the_facade.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cracks in the Façade 25 Years Ago, EPA Linked Fracking to Water Contamination.pdf","md5":"056ae493a680ec59a6a0510be0d74111","mtime":1525354146474,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-03T13:29:02Z","dateModified":"2018-05-03T13:29:06Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"H2VZ5NXH","version":498,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H2VZ5NXH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H2VZ5NXH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Hydraulic Fracturing &amp; Water Stress: Growing Competitive Pressures for Water.&#x201D; Ceres.

Yet because these developments in unconventional extraction industries are so new, data for analysis is limited. This study examines recent activity in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas with a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) approach using data collected from 14 actively producing counties over a four year period from 2008-2011. Results indicate that the number of completed oil and gas wells has had a positive impact on per-capita income to-date. Previous research suggests that communities in South Texas have the opportunity to overcome the resource curse, but that it will require good local governance and thoughtful long-term planning.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"11","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:49:04Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:49:04Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"DIX4NHB3","version":1010,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DIX4NHB3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DIX4NHB3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Reinventing Regulation: The Impact of US Reform on the Oil and Gas Industry.&#x201D; Accessed May 3, 2018. https://www.energiaadebate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/glnobledenton20130506Reinventingregulationtheimpactoftheusreformontheoygindustry.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DIX4NHB3","version":1010,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Reinventing Regulation: The impact of US reform on the oil and gas industry","accessDate":"2018-05-03T13:46:58Z","url":"https://www.energiaadebate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/glnobledenton20130506Reinventingregulationtheimpactoftheusreformontheoygindustry.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Reinventing Regulation The impact of US reform on the oil and gas industry.pdf","md5":"0a9b6470a3b6baa0a053dd2bba412a4d","mtime":1525355221060,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-03T13:46:58Z","dateModified":"2018-05-03T13:47:01Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"SW72HJLH","version":1013,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SW72HJLH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SW72HJLH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Global Shale Gas Intitiative: Will the United States Be the Role Model for the Development of Shale Gas Around the World?&#x201D; Accessed May 3, 2018. http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-33-2-sakmar.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"SW72HJLH","version":1013,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"The Global Shale Gas Intitiative: Will the United States be the Role Model for the Development of Shale Gas Around the World?","accessDate":"2018-05-03T13:49:02Z","url":"http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-33-2-sakmar.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"The Global Shale Gas Intitiative Will the United States be the Role Model for the Development of Shale Gas Around the World.pdf","md5":"48985c5b3a8bf75fd729b6f67a4325de","mtime":1525355346861,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-03T13:49:02Z","dateModified":"2018-05-03T13:49:07Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"BJA8YFXU","version":542,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BJA8YFXU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BJA8YFXU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brunnschweiler and Bulte","parsedDate":"2008","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brunnschweiler, Christa N., and Erwin H.

Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1–2 percentage points (a 6–11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"23-38","date":"11// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.003","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Mineral rights"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Oil"},{"tag":"Royalty payments"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"S48M2RAJ","version":260,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/S48M2RAJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/S48M2RAJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brasington","parsedDate":"2002","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brasington, David M. &#x201C;Edge versus Center: Finding Common Ground in the Capitalization Debate.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Urban Economics</i> 52 (2002): 524&#x2013;41. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0094-1190(02)00532-6.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"S48M2RAJ","version":260,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Edge versus center: finding common ground in the capitalization debate","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David M.","lastName":"Brasington"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Journal of Urban Economics","volume":"52","issue":"","pages":"524-541","date":"11// 2002","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0094-1190(02)00532-6","ISSN":"0094-1190","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Capitalization"},{"tag":"Crime"},{"tag":"Education"},{"tag":"House price hedonic"},{"tag":"Local public goods"},{"tag":"Taxes"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:53Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"DK6D3LXR","version":538,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DK6D3LXR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DK6D3LXR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brantley et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brantley, Susan L., Dave Yoxtheimer, Sina Arjmand, Paul Grieve, Radisav Vidic, Jon Pollak, Garth T.

Two potential pathways-advective transport through bulk media and preferential flow through fractures-could allow the transport of contaminants from the fractured shale to aquifers. There is substantial geologic evidence that natural vertical flow drives contaminants, mostly brine, to near the surface from deep evaporite sources. Interpretative modeling shows that advective transport could require up to tens of thousands of years to move contaminants to the surface, but also that fracking the shale could reduce that transport time to tens or hundreds of years. Conductive faults or fracture zones, as found throughout the Marcellus shale region, could reduce the travel time further. Injection of up to 15,000,000 L of fluid into the shale generates high pressure at the well, which decreases with distance from the well and with time after injection as the fluid advects through the shale. The advection displaces native fluids, mostly brine, and fractures the bulk media widening existing fractures. Simulated pressure returns to pre-injection levels in about 300 d. The overall system requires from 3 to 6 years to reach a new equilibrium reflecting the significant changes caused by fracking the shale, which could allow advective transport to aquifers in less than 10 years. The rapid expansion of hydraulic fracturing requires that monitoring systems be employed to track the movement of contaminants and that gas wells have a reasonable offset from faults.","publicationTitle":"Ground Water","volume":"50","issue":"6","pages":"872-882","date":"2012 Nov-Dec","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ground Water","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00933.x","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 22509908","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental Monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Fossil Fuels","type":1},{"tag":"Geologic Sediments","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Industrial Waste","type":1},{"tag":"Models, Statistical","type":1},{"tag":"New York","type":1},{"tag":"Risk Factors","type":1},{"tag":"Salts","type":1},{"tag":"Time Factors","type":1},{"tag":"Water Movements","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollutants, Chemical","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T15:21:38Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T15:21:38Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"KVL3UDBK","version":1080,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KVL3UDBK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KVL3UDBK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;National Parks and Hydraulic Fracturing.&#x201D; National Parks Conservation Association.

Its opponents dispute these claims and point to significant environmental and public health risks associated with hydrofracking-risks that must be considered in adopting government regulations needed to protect the public interest. One of the many issues raised by hydrofracking is which level of government should regulate which aspects of the practice. This debate is complicated by the fact that the risks associated with hydrofracking raise concerns of federal, state, and local importance and fit within existing regulatory regimes of each of these levels of government. This Article begins by describing the limited aspects of hydrofracking that are currently regulated by the federal government, which leaves many of the risks unaddressed, opening the door for state and local regulation. This Article describes the legal tension between state and local governments in regulating hydrofracking in the four states that contain the immense Marcellus shale formation. Its particular focus is on court decisions that determine whether local land use regulation, which typically regulates local industrial activity, has been preempted by state statutes that historically regulate gas drilling operations. This investigation suggests that the broad scope and durability of local land use power as a key feature of municipal governance tends to make courts reluctant to usurp local prerogatives in the absence of extraordinarily clear' and express language of preemption in state statutes that regulate gas drilling. The Article concludes with an examination of how the legitimate interests and legal authority of all three levels of government can be integrated in a system of cooperative governance.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"47","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T17:23:12Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T17:23:12Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"LF59LTS9","version":1156,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LF59LTS9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LF59LTS9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Pennsylvania Marcellus Natural Gas Industry: Status, Economic Impacts and Future Potential.&#x201D; Accessed May 4, 2018. http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Final-2011-PA-Marcellus-Economic-Impacts.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LF59LTS9","version":1156,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"The Pennsylvania Marcellus Natural Gas Industry: Status, Economic Impacts and Future Potential","accessDate":"2018-05-04T17:24:01Z","url":"http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Final-2011-PA-Marcellus-Economic-Impacts.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"The Pennsylvania Marcellus Natural Gas Industry Status, Economic Impacts and Future Potential.pdf","md5":"e83675848bcf5d6995a93c6962c33cfa","mtime":1525454646485,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T17:24:01Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T17:24:06Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"YRI2SS6Z","version":1168,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YRI2SS6Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YRI2SS6Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Impact of Marcellus Gas Drilling on Rural Drinking Water Supplies.&#x201D; Accessed May 4, 2018. https://fracfocus.org/sites/default/files/publications/marcellus_and_drinking_water_2011_rev_0.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"YRI2SS6Z","version":1168,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"The Impact of Marcellus Gas Drilling on Rural Drinking Water Supplies","accessDate":"2018-05-04T17:24:48Z","url":"https://fracfocus.org/sites/default/files/publications/marcellus_and_drinking_water_2011_rev_0.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"The Impact of Marcellus Gas Drilling on Rural Drinking Water Supplies.pdf","md5":"161565569a3e67cc5b7f94a0014de88a","mtime":1525454691112,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T17:24:48Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T17:24:51Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"72GWJPGJ","version":621,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/72GWJPGJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/72GWJPGJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;North American Natural Gas: Navigating a Fractured Future | Deloitte US | Energy &amp; Resources.&#x201D; Deloitte United States.

During application, severe damage and mortality of ground vegetation was observed, followed about 10 d later by premature leaf drop by the overstory trees. Two years after fluid application, 56% of the trees within the fluid application area were dead. Ehrh. was the tree species with the highest mortality, and L. was the least affected, although all tree species present on the site showed damage symptoms and mortality. Surface soils (0-10 cm) were sampled in July and October 2008, June and October 2009, and May 2010 on the fluid application area and an adjacent reference area to evaluate the effects of the hydrofracturing fluid on soil chemistry and to attempt to identify the main chemical constituents of the hydrofracturing fluid. Surface soil concentrations of sodium and chloride increased 50-fold as a result of the land application of hydrofracturing fluids and declined over time. Soil acidity in the fluid application area declined with time, perhaps from altered organic matter cycling. This case study identifies the need for further research to help understand the nature and the environmental impacts of hydrofracturing fluids to devise optimal, safe disposal strategies.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Quality","volume":"40","issue":"4","pages":"1340-1344","date":"2011 Jul-Aug","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Aggregate revenues from production taxes nearly doubled in real terms over the period, reaching $10.3 billion and accounting for 20% of tax receipts in the top ten revenue states. The average state had a tax rate of 3.6%; nationally, the average dollar of production was taxed at 4.2%. The oil-specific rate estimated for the study period is $2.4 per barrel or $5.5 per ton of carbon. Lastly, state-level tax rates are two-thirds higher in states excluding oil and gas wells from local property taxes, suggesting that the policies are substitutes for one another.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"96","issue":"","pages":"289-301","date":"9","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2016.06.008","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"A quantitative description of state-level taxation of oil and gas production in the continental U.S","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302920","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Effective rates"},{"tag":"Oil and gas taxation"},{"tag":"State policy"}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"DXIA6D7I","version":1261,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DXIA6D7I","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DXIA6D7I","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kresse et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Revenues surge as drilling expands during booms, creating many pressures for immediate expenditure. This often sets up enormous strain during bust periods when revenues plunge as longer-term needs emerge. This paper, however, examines the small set of states that have devised unique mechanisms to prepare for future busts. It reviews two periods (1970s and 2010s) in which six oil and gas-producing states amended their state constitutions to place severance tax revenues into permanent trust funds for long-term stewardship. It examines the key political factors that prompted the formation of these funds while also considering their resilience and performance to date.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"20","issue":"","pages":"117-127","date":"10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.06.011","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Trusting in the future: The re-emergence of state trust funds in the shale era","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616301402","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy"},{"tag":"Fracking"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Severance taxes"},{"tag":"Shale"},{"tag":"Trust funds"}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"RXUTEFYH","version":1280,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RXUTEFYH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RXUTEFYH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

A difference-in-difference fixed effects model and a spatial modeling to incorporate spatial heterogeneity and dependence among U.S. local areas that are in close geographical proximity are employed in this study. The results show that MRE industry employment grew faster during boom periods and slower during the bust period in MRE dependent counties. MRE earnings and earnings per worker grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. The findings give evidence of negative spatial indirect spillover effects between neighboring counties’ MRE sector labor markets. An analysis of the effect of shocks in the MRE sector on the non-MRE sectors shows that in MRE dependent counties non-MRE sector employment grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. Positive shocks in the MRE sector had no effect on the manufacturing sector labor market; however, negative shocks had a positively effect. Booms in the MRE sector positively impacted the construction sector, while negatively affecting the service and retail trade sectors’ labor markets in MRE dependent counties. Finally, this study finds that male population grew faster, while female population grew slower in the MRE dependent counties.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"292-305","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.09.009","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"Local economic impact of boom and bust in mineral resource extraction in the United States: A spatial econometrics analysis","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716302434","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Boom and bust"},{"tag":"Local economic impact"},{"tag":"Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE)"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"MN3VB3YB","version":1284,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MN3VB3YB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MN3VB3YB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Spence","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Spence, David B. &#x201C;Federalism, Regulatory Lags, and the Political Economy of Energy Production.&#x201D; <i>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</i> 161 (n.d.): 78.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"MN3VB3YB","version":1284,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Federalism, Regulatory Lags, and the Political Economy of Energy Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David B","lastName":"Spence"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"University of Pennsylvania Law Review","volume":"161","issue":"","pages":"78","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:33:08Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:33:08Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"JA7649K6","version":1288,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JA7649K6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JA7649K6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Disclosure of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluids: Are States Doing a Good Enough Job?&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/legacy/State%20chemical%20disclosure%20requirements_1.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"JA7649K6","version":1288,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Disclosure of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluids: Are States Doing a Good Enough Job?","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:33:25Z","url":"https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/legacy/State%20chemical%20disclosure%20requirements_1.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Disclosure of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluids Are States Doing a Good Enough Job.pdf","md5":"7a5fdf8645e279ba8550de50f52e0189","mtime":1525707210784,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:33:25Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:33:30Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"77TVQTBT","version":600,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/77TVQTBT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/77TVQTBT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mayer et al.","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mayer, Adam, Shawn K.

However, empirical evidence is limited. In this article, we consider the socioeconomic effects (particularly, related to poverty, employment, income, and wages) of unconventional oil and gas extraction using a national data set of U.S. counties. We use a novel between- and within-county random effects modeling strategy to capture both resource curse and boomtown dynamics. Further, we allow the effect of oil and gas development to be conditioned by county rurality. Broadly, our findings suggest that oil and gas development has very complex effects at the county level. Within-county growth in oil and gas production slightly improves most economic outcomes, but counties that specialize in oil and gas development tend to perform worse than other counties. We find that, in general, the effect of within-county oil and gas production is not significantly moderated by county rurality.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"n/a-n/a","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rural Sociology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12198","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"Fracking Fortunes","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ruso.12198/abstract","accessDate":"2017-12-18T15:46:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"9VEVNEV7","version":599,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9VEVNEV7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9VEVNEV7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marchand","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Less examined are communities on the periphery of such development, which experience related impacts unique to their location. Twenty-eight long-time residents from three Bakken periphery communities were interviewed to evaluate social and environmental impact perceptions, including perceived risks of place disruption. Findings suggest that whereas place meanings and identities were disrupted by the oil boom in Bakken core communities, they remain intact in these periphery communities. Findings further suggest periphery residents view their proximal location to the Bakken region as a social and economic “Goldilocks Zone:” close enough to benefit from spillover economic impacts, yet far enough away to avoid serious negative social impacts. This research extends understanding of place disruption and development impacts in energy periphery communities.","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2017.1376138","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:58:45Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"4B8TCFWP","version":1295,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4B8TCFWP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4B8TCFWP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

From 1988 onward, Alaskan oil production steadily declined. The temporal characteristics of the Alaskan oil boom make for an ideal case study of the economic effects of resource booms more generally. The boom generated significant short-run economic gains that were quickly diluted by inward migration. In the long run though, the income gains may have turned into losses. These results are robust to using a variety of comparison units, including a synthetic control.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"270-275","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.10.008","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"The long-run vanity of Prudhoe Bay","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716302057","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Alaska"},{"tag":"Oil Boom"},{"tag":"Resource Curse"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"NSI4M7DS","version":1300,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NSI4M7DS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NSI4M7DS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Drawing on the risk literature, recent opinion surveys, and case studies of regulation in eight states, we find that UGD is an emerging technology that is likely to be perceived as risky, even though the two most commonly claimed risks, water contamination and induced seismicity, appear to be controllable through competent industry and regulatory practices. Perceived risk is likely to increase as the technology is used more widely in the United States but any public outrage is likely to be attenuated because of perceived benefits and related forms of risk compensation for individuals and communities. The types of triggering events necessary for large-scale social amplification and stigmatization have not yet occurred but organized interests against UGD are becoming stronger and are exerting significant influence. It is too early to determine whether UGD will become stigmatized in the same way that nuclear power and genetically modified foods are now stigmatized in some regions of the world.","publicationTitle":"Risk Analysis","volume":"35","issue":"10","pages":"1770-1788","date":"10/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/risa.12512","ISSN":"02724332","shortTitle":"Unconventional Gas Development in the USA","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/risa.12512","accessDate":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"8U4ZRTMW","version":1302,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8U4ZRTMW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8U4ZRTMW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"AVALOS and BURNETT","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">AVALOS, MONA, and DAVID B BURNETT. &#x201C;Public Perception of Desalinated Produced Water From Oil and Gas Filed Operations: A Replication,&#x201D; n.d., 15.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"8U4ZRTMW","version":1302,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Public Perception of Desalinated Produced Water From Oil and Gas Filed Operations: A Replication","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"MONA","lastName":"AVALOS"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"DAVID B","lastName":"BURNETT"}],"abstractNote":"This study is a replication of Theodori et al.’s (2009) research on public perception of desalinated produced water from oil and gas field operations. The data used in this paper were collected in twelve Texas counties. Overall, the findings of this investigation paralleled those uncovered in Theodori et al.’s original exploration. Our data reveal that small percentages of respondents are extremely familiar with the process of desalination and extremely confident that desalinated water could meet human drinking water quality and purity standards. Our data also indicate that respondents are more favorably disposed toward the use of desalinated water for purposes where the probability of human or animal ingestion is lessened. Lastly, our data show that individuals with higher levels of familiarity with the process of desalination were more likely than those with lower levels of familiarity to agree that desalinated water from oil and gas field operations could safely be used for each of nine proposed purposes. Possible implications of these findings are advanced.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"15","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:11:36Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:11:44Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"4TLVRE3N","version":702,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4TLVRE3N","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4TLVRE3N","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

While the impact of the offset on long-term development prospects is not clear, there is a risk of significant adjustment costs in moving to a higher level of domestic taxation once natural resources are depleted.","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Political Economy","volume":"25","issue":"4","pages":"439-446","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2009.01.003","ISSN":"0176-2680","shortTitle":"Natural resource endowments and the domestic revenue effort","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268009000068","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Domestic revenue effort"},{"tag":"Hydrocarbon revenues"}],"collections":["4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"HQRLNBRI","version":1318,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HQRLNBRI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HQRLNBRI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Economic Impacts of Oil &amp; Gas Development on Federal Lands in the West.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. https://www.westernenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Final-Combined-ES-Econ-Impacts-of-OG-Dev-on-Fed-Lands-in-the-West.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"HQRLNBRI","version":1318,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Economic Impacts of Oil & Gas Development on Federal Lands in the West","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:13:06Z","url":"https://www.westernenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Final-Combined-ES-Econ-Impacts-of-OG-Dev-on-Fed-Lands-in-the-West.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Economic Impacts of Oil & Gas Development on Federal Lands in the West.pdf","md5":"b834f3ea661ae94e5c1687b053155829","mtime":1525709590059,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:13:06Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:13:10Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"D5KZCAAS","version":1321,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/D5KZCAAS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/D5KZCAAS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Business Impact of Proposed Changes to Well Completion Regulations.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. https://www.westernenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Revised-Cost-Memo.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"D5KZCAAS","version":1321,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Business Impact of Proposed Changes to Well Completion Regulations","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:13:45Z","url":"https://www.westernenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Revised-Cost-Memo.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Business Impact of Proposed Changes to Well Completion Regulations.pdf","md5":"58b8461e9b901bf6371c5ca3b6338abc","mtime":1525709631229,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:13:45Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:13:51Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"LMV84MUS","version":1323,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LMV84MUS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LMV84MUS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Oil Shale 2050 - What You Need to Know.&#x201D; Western Resource Advocates.

Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a 23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process. Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that prenatal UOG-MIX exposures would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland. Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to approximately 3, 30, 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX from gestational day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females prior to puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX developed more dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-MIX-treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds, i.e., highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty. These results suggest that the mammary gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in unconventional oil and gas production, at exposure levels that are environmentally relevant. The impact of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.","publicationTitle":"Endocrinology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Endocrinology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1210/en.2017-00866","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/endo/advance-article/doi/10.1210/en.2017-00866/4841948","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:56:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"PF7A2F3Y","version":1366,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PF7A2F3Y","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PF7A2F3Y","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Air Quality Report from Dish, Texas.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. https://townofdish.com/objects/DISH_-_final_report_revised.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"PF7A2F3Y","version":1366,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Air Quality Report from Dish, Texas","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:28:54Z","url":"https://townofdish.com/objects/DISH_-_final_report_revised.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Air Quality Report from Dish, Texas.pdf","md5":"a165d48df4bb03de722d7ff082088d46","mtime":1525710536047,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:28:54Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:28:56Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"UC3L7GXG","version":600,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UC3L7GXG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UC3L7GXG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mayer","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mayer, Adam. &#x201C;Quality of Life and Unconventional Oil and Gas Development: Towards a Comprehensive Impact Model for Host Communities.&#x201D; <i>The Extractive Industries and Society</i>.

Oil and gas drilling often occurs in close proximity to where people live and work, creating the potential for significant quality of life impacts. In this review, we integrate across diverse literatures to develop a holistic account of how oil and gas development might impact quality of life in host communities. Our review suggests that the potential effect of oil and gas development is complex, as it can provide economic growth for beleaguered rural areas but also degrade human health, environmental quality and have other deleterious impacts. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research.","publicationTitle":"The Extractive Industries and Society","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Extractive Industries and Society","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.exis.2017.10.009","ISSN":"2214-790X","shortTitle":"Quality of life and unconventional oil and gas development","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X17301326","accessDate":"2017-11-14T15:01:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas","type":1},{"tag":"Quality of life","type":1}],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"2ZQVNYK3","version":1368,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2ZQVNYK3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2ZQVNYK3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

The United States is expected to go from a net importer of natural gas to a net exporter by 2020. Projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) by tanker ship have been proposed—cumulatively accounting for about 12.5% of current U.S. natural gas production—and are at varying stages of regulatory approval. Projects require federal approval under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. §717b), with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission being the lead authorizing agencies. Pipeline exports, which accounted for 94% of all exports of U.S. produced natural gas in 2010, are also likely to rise.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"30","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:42:44Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:42:44Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"E4F775BJ","version":1393,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/E4F775BJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/E4F775BJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Increased Federal Criminal Enforcement Against Oil and Gas Fracking Companies: Environmental and Natural Resources Law, Attorneys, Beveridge &amp; Diamond.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. http://www.bdlaw.com/news-1441.html.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"E4F775BJ","version":1393,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Increased Federal Criminal Enforcement Against Oil and Gas Fracking Companies: Environmental and Natural Resources Law, Attorneys, Beveridge & Diamond","creators":[],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"Increased Federal Criminal Enforcement Against Oil and Gas Fracking Companies","url":"http://www.bdlaw.com/news-1441.html","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:44:01Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:44:01Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:44:01Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"4NIL6MBH","version":1397,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4NIL6MBH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4NIL6MBH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Powering California: The Monterey Shale &amp; California&#x2019;s Economic Future.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.usc.edu/dist/d/120/files/2018/03/84955-27h75wa.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4NIL6MBH","version":1397,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Powering California: The Monterey Shale & California's Economic Future","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:44:28Z","url":"https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.usc.edu/dist/d/120/files/2018/03/84955-27h75wa.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Powering California The Monterey Shale & California's Economic Future.pdf","md5":"295054da5157968c3ac9fb6c61c9b418","mtime":1525711472560,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:44:28Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:44:33Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"22N9RRBF","version":1399,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/22N9RRBF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/22N9RRBF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;The Next Frontier in United States Unconventional Shale Gas and Tight Oil Extraction: Strategic Reduction of Environmental Impact.&#x201D; Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

With technological advances, hydraulic fracturing is now widely used to initiate oil and gas production in unconventional (low-permeability) oil and gas formations that were previously inaccessible. This process now is used in more than 90% of new oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is done after a well is drilled and involves injecting large volumes of water, sand (or other propping agent), and specialized chemicals under enough pressure to fracture the formations holding the oil or gas. The sand or other proppant holds the fractures open to allow the oil or gas to flow freely out of the formation and into a production well. Its application, along with horizontal drilling, for production of natural gas (methane) from tight gas sands, unconventional shale formations, and coal beds, has resulted in the marked expansion of estimated U.S. natural gas reserves in recent years. Similarly, hydraulic fracturing is enabling the development of tight oil resources, such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations. The rapid growth in the use of fracturing has raised concerns over its potential impacts on groundwater and drinking water sources, and has led to calls for more state and/or federal oversight of this activity.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"43","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T17:08:35Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T17:08:35Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"PDQZ28PZ","version":1421,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PDQZ28PZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PDQZ28PZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Drill, Baby, Drill: Can Unconventional Fuels Usher in a New Era of Energy Abundance?

Some recent studies have suggested that such upward migration can be large and that timescales for migration can be as short as a few years. In this article, we discuss the physical constraints on upward fluid migration from black shales (e.g., the Marcellus, Bakken, and Eagle Ford) to shallow aquifers, taking into account the potential changes to the subsurface brought about by HF. Our review of the literature indicates that HF affects a very limited portion of the entire thickness of the overlying bedrock and therefore, is unable to create direct hydraulic communication between black shales and shallow aquifers via induced fractures. As a result, upward migration of HF fluid and brine is controlled by preexisting hydraulic gradients and bedrock permeability. We show that in cases where there is an upward gradient, permeability is low, upward flow rates are low, and mean travel times are long (often >10⁶  years). Consequently, the recently proposed rapid upward migration of brine and HF fluid, predicted to occur as a result of increased HF activity, does not appear to be physically plausible. Unrealistically high estimates of upward flow are the result of invalid assumptions about HF and the hydrogeology of sedimentary basins.","publicationTitle":"Ground Water","volume":"52","issue":"1","pages":"9-19","date":"2014 Jan-Feb","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ground Water","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1111/gwat.12095","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23895673\nPMCID: PMC4321062","tags":[{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Permeability","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1},{"tag":"Water Movements","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollution, Chemical","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:56:02.000Z"}},{"key":"75UAJ7CZ","version":1478,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/75UAJ7CZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/75UAJ7CZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rosa et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rosa, Lorenzo, Maria Cristina Rulli, Kyle Frankel Davis, and Paolo D&#x2019;Odorico. &#x201C;The Water-Energy Nexus of Hydraulic Fracturing: A Global Hydrologic Analysis for Shale Oil and Gas Extraction.&#x201D; <i>Earth&#x2019;s Future</i> 0, no. 0.

Extraction of shale oil and shale gas is generally performed through water-intensive hydraulic fracturing. Despite recent work on its environmental impacts, it remains unclear where and to what extent shale resource extraction could compete with other water needs. Here we consider the global distribution of known shale deposits suitable for oil and gas extraction and develop a water balance model to quantify their impacts on local water availability for other human uses and ecosystem functions. We find that 31–44% of the world's shale deposits are located in areas where water stress would either emerge or be exacerbated as a result of shale oil or gas extraction; 20% of shale deposits are in areas affected by groundwater depletion and 30% in irrigated land. In these regions shale oil and shale gas production would likely compete for local water resources with agriculture, environmental flows, and other water needs. By adopting a hydrologic perspective that considers water availability and demand together, decision makers and local communities can better understand the water and food security implications of shale resource development.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2018EF000809","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"The Water-Energy Nexus of Hydraulic Fracturing","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2018EF000809","accessDate":"2018-06-11T14:00:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2018.
