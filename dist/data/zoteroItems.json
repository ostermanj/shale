This occurred largely because of the development of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing which allows access to fossil fuels from geologic formations that were previously not cost effective to pursue. This process is known to use greater than 1,000 chemicals such as solvents, surfactants, detergents, and biocides. In addition, a complex mixture of chemicals, including heavy metals, naturally-occurring radioactive chemicals, and organic compounds are released from the formations and can enter air and water. Compounds associated with UOG activity have been linked to adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes in humans and laboratory animal models, which is possibly due to the presence of endocrine active chemicals. Using systematic methods, electronic searches of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify studies that measured chemicals in air near sites of UOG activity. Records were screened by title and abstract, relevant articles then underwent full text review, and data were extracted from the studies. A list of chemicals detected near UOG sites was generated. Then, the potential endocrine activity of the most frequently detected chemicals was explored via searches of literature from PubMed. Evaluation of 48 studies that sampled air near sites of UOG activity identified 106 chemicals detected in two or more studies. Ethane, benzene and n-pentane were the top three most frequently detected. Twenty-one chemicals have been shown to have endocrine activity including estrogenic and androgenic activity and the ability to alter steroidogenesis. Literature also suggested that some of the air pollutants may affect reproduction, development, and neurophysiological function, all endpoints which can be modulated by hormones. These chemicals included aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mercury. These results provide a basis for prioritizing future primary studies regarding the endocrine disrupting properties of UOG air pollutants, including exposure research in wildlife and humans. Further, we recommend systematic reviews of the health impacts of exposure to specific chemicals, and comprehensive environmental sampling of a broader array of chemicals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Health","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"26","date":"2018/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","ISSN":"1476-069X","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","accessDate":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ehjournal.biomedcentral.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s).","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateModified":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateString":"December 2018","dateValue":"2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"5HWAQNW3","version":11,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5HWAQNW3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5HWAQNW3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Munasib and Rickman","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Munasib, Abdul, and Dan S.

Exploration, drilling and extraction are associated with direct increases in employment and income in the energy industry, but little is known about the impacts on other parts of local economies. Increased energy sector employment and income can have positive spillover effects through increased purchases of intermediate goods and induced local spending. Negative spillover effects can occur through rising local factor and goods prices and adverse effects on the local area quality of life. Therefore, this paper examines the net economic impacts of oil and gas production from shale formations for key shale oil and gas producing areas in Arkansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is used to establish a baseline projection for the local economies in the absence of increased energy development, allowing for estimation of the net regional economic effects of increased shale oil and gas production.","publicationTitle":"Regional Science and Urban Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"0000 forthcoming","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2014.10.006","ISSN":"0166-0462","shortTitle":"Regional Economic Impacts of the Shale Gas and Tight Oil Boom: A Synthetic Control Analysis","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046214001094","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts"},{"tag":"Shale oil and gas"},{"tag":"Synthetic control method"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"forthcoming","dateValue":"2018-04-06T12:43:30.523Z"}},{"key":"RK6DZUWA","version":229,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RK6DZUWA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RK6DZUWA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bean et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-29","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bean, Jeffrey Kevin, Sahil Bhandari, Anthony Bilotto, and Lea Hildebrandt Ruiz. &#x201C;Formation of Particulate Matter from the Oxidation of Evaporated Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>, March 29, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b06009.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"RK6DZUWA","version":229,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Formation of Particulate Matter from the Oxidation of Evaporated Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeffrey Kevin","lastName":"Bean"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sahil","lastName":"Bhandari"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Bilotto"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lea","lastName":"Hildebrandt Ruiz"}],"abstractNote":"The use of hydraulic fracturing for production of petroleum and natural gas has increased dramatically in the last decade, but the environmental impacts of this technology remain unclear. Experiments were conducted to quantify airborne emissions from twelve samples of hydraulic fracturing flowback wastewater collected in the Permian Basin, as well as the photochemical processing of these emissions leading to the formation of particulate matter. The concentration of total volatile carbon (TVC, hydrocarbons evaporating at room temperature) averaged 29 mg of carbon (C) L-1. After photochemical oxidation under high NOx conditions the amount of organic particulate matter (PM) formed per milliliter of wastewater evaporated averaged 24 µg; the amount of ammonium nitrate formed averaged 262 µg. Based on the mean PM formation observed in these experiments, the estimated formation of PM from evaporated flowback wastewater in the state of Texas is in the range of estimated PM emissions from diesel engines used in oil rigs. Evaporation of flowback wastewater, a hitherto unrecognized source of secondary pollutants, could significantly contribute to ambient PM concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 29, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"13","issue":"3","pages":"e0194203","date":"Mar 23, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","accessDate":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.plos.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T13:53:34Z","dateString":"March 23, 2018","dateValue":"2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"TAGT9H37","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TAGT9H37","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TAGT9H37","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zavala-Araiza et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-22","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zavala-Araiza, Daniel, Scott C.

In the region that is densely populated with oil producing facilities, many localized geohazards, such as ground subsidence and micro-earthquakes, have gone unnoticed. Here we identify the localized geohazards in West Texas, using the satellite radar interferometry from newly launched radar satellites that provide radar images freely to public for the first time, and probe the causal mechanisms of ground deformation, encompassing oil/gas production activities and subsurface geological characteristics. Based on our observations and analyses, human activities of fluid (saltwater, CO2) injection for stimulation of hydrocarbon production, salt dissolution in abandoned oil facilities, and hydrocarbon extraction each have negative impacts on the ground surface and infrastructures, including possible induced seismicity.

In recent years, seismicity has been concentrated near Pecos, Texas; around the Dagger Draw Field, New Mexico; and near the Cogdell Field, Snyder, Texas. We have collected hundreds of measurements of stress orientation and relative magnitude to identify potentially active normal, normal/strike-slip, or strike-slip faults that might be susceptible to earthquake triggering in this region. In the Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform, the faulting regime is consistently normal/strike slip, and the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) is approximately east–west, although modest rotations of the SHmax direction are seen in some areas. Within the Delaware Basin, however, a large-magnitude clockwise rotation (∼150°) of SHmax occurs progressively from being nearly north–south in the north to east-southeast–west-northwest...","publicationTitle":"The Leading Edge","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2018-02-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1190/tle37020127.1","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"State of stress in the Permian Basin, Texas and New Mexico","url":"https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle37020127.1","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:57:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"world","libraryCatalog":"library.seg.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"February 2, 2018","dateValue":"2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7EHSXI5C","version":121,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goh and Ang","parsedDate":"2018-02-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goh, Tian, and B.

There is no standard approach to tackle this problem. The most common approach, which is known as the primary energy equivalent (PEE) approach, estimates emission reductions by computing the amount of CO2 emissions that would have been emitted from fossil fuels had renewables or nuclear energy not been used. Another approach, the Equal Share (ES) approach, estimates emission reductions based on the change in the share of non-fossil based energy. As the two approaches have some limitations, a more comprehensive approach based on index decomposition analysis (IDA) is proposed as an alternative, together with an extension to quantify substitution amongst non-fossil based sources. A comparison of the assumptions and features of all three approaches is presented. The study finds that IDA is favoured for its ability to identify policy intervention areas beyond a switch to cleaner energy and is well-suited for tracking of progress towards emission reduction targets and analysing future scenarios.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"651-662","date":"February 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.019","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517307656","accessDate":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Decarbonisation","type":1},{"tag":"Emission reductions","type":1},{"tag":"Index decomposition analysis","type":1},{"tag":"LMDI","type":1},{"tag":"Paasche index","type":1},{"tag":"Renewable energy","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateString":"February 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GS5Z8M5J","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ravikumar et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ravikumar, Arvind P., Jingfan Wang, Mike McGuire, Clay S.

A key feature of recent methane mitigation policies is the use of periodic leak detection surveys, typically done with optical gas imaging (OGI) technologies. The most common OGI technology is an infrared camera. In this work, we experimentally develop detection probability curves for OGI-based methane leak detection under different environmental and imaging conditions. Controlled single blind leak detection tests show that the median detection limit (50% detection likelihood) for FLIR-camera based OGI technology is about 20 g CH4/h at an imaging distance of 6 m, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported estimates of 1.4 g CH4/h. Furthermore, we show that median and 90% detection likelihood limit follows a power-law relationship with imaging distance. Finally, we demonstrate that real-world marginal effectiveness of methane mitigation through periodic surveys approaches zero as leak detection sensitivity improves. For example, a median detection limit of 100 g CH4/h is sufficient to detect the maximum amount of leakage that is possible through periodic surveys. Policy makers should take note of these limits while designing equivalence metrics for next-generation leak detection technologies that can trade sensitivity for cost without affecting mitigation priorities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 19, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

While this practice was largely discontinued in 2011 for unconventional Marcellus OGW, it continues for conventional OGW. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental implications of the policy allowing the disposal of conventional OGW. We collected stream sediments from three discharge sites receiving treated OGW between 2014-2017 and measured 228Ra, 226Ra, and their decay products, 228Th and 210Pb, respectively. We consistently found elevated activities of 228Ra and 226Ra in stream sediments in the vicinity of the outfall (total Ra = 90-25,000 Bq/kg) compared to upstream sediments (20-80 Bq/kg). In 2015 and 2017, 228Th/228Ra activity ratios in sediments from two disposal sites were relatively low (0.2-0.7), indicating that a portion of the Ra has accumulated in the sediments in recent (<3) years, when no unconventional Marcellus OGW was reportedly discharged. 228Ra/226Ra activity ratios were also higher than what would be expected solely from disposal of low 228Ra/226Ra Marcellus OGW. Based on these variations, we concluded that recent disposal of treated conventional OGW is the source of high Ra in stream sediments at CWT facility disposal sites. Consequently, policies pertaining to the disposal of only unconventional fluids are not adequate in preventing radioactive contamination in sediments at disposal sites, and the permission to release of treated Ra-rich conventional OGW through CWT facilities should be reconsidered.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 4, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

There have been multiple reports of air and water contamination by volatile organic compounds in the vicinity of gas wells. Although these chemicals are known developmental toxicants, no biomonitoring effort has been carried out in the region.\nObjective\nTo evaluate gestational exposure to benzene and toluene in the Peace River Valley, Northeastern British Columbia (Canada).\nMethods\nUrine samples were collected over five consecutive days from 29 pregnant women. Metabolites of benzene (s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA)) and toluene (s-benzylmercapturic acid (S-BMA)) were measured in pooled urine samples from each participant. Levels of benzene metabolites were compared to those from the general Canadian population and from a biomonitoring study of residents from an area of active gas exploitation in Pavillion, Wyoming (USA). Levels measured in participants from the two recruitment sites, and self-identifying as Indigenous or non-Indigenous, were also compared.\nResults\nWhereas the median S-PMA level (0.18 μg/g creatinine) in our study was similar to that in the general Canadian population, the median t,t-MA level (180 μg/g creatinine) was approximately 3.5 times higher. Five women had t,t-MA levels above the biological exposure index® proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The median urinary S-BMA level in our pilot study was 7.00 μg/g creatinine. Urinary metabolite levels were slightly higher in self-identifying Indigenous women, but this difference was only statistically significant for S-PMA.\nDiscussion\nUrinary t,t-MA levels, but not S-PMA levels, measured in our study are suggestive of a higher benzene exposure in participating pregnant women from the Peace River Valley than in the general Canadian population. Given the small sample size and limitations of t,t-MA measurements (e.g., non-specificity), more extensive monitoring is warranted.","publicationTitle":"Environment International","volume":"110","issue":"","pages":"131-138","date":"January 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environment International","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022","ISSN":"0160-4120","shortTitle":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017310309","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:05:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 2018","dateValue":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"Q49YC7WI","version":203,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q49YC7WI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q49YC7WI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Newell and Raimi","parsedDate":"2018-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Newell, Richard G., and Daniel Raimi. &#x201C;US State and Local Oil and Gas Revenue Sources and Uses.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 112, no.

We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas-producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10% of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1% to a high of nearly 40% (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments’ current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"112","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"12-18","date":"January 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.002","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517306250","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:32:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Resource taxation","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 1, 2018","dateValue":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9GDUZ58L","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Worden et al.","parsedDate":"2017-12-20","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Worden, John R., A.

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local.

Since 2009, earthquake activity in the CUS has increased markedly, and numerous publications suggest that this increase is primarily due to induced earthquakes caused by deep-well injection of wastewater, both flowback water from hydrofracturing operations and produced water accompanying hydrocarbon production. Alternatively, some argue that these earthquakes are natural and that the seismicity increase is a normal variation that occurs over millions of years. Our analysis shows that within the NME, faults deform both Quaternary alluvium and underlying sediments dating from Paleozoic through Tertiary, with displacement increasing with geologic unit age, documenting a long history of natural activity. In the FWB, a region of ongoing wastewater injection, basement faults show deformation of the Proterozoic and Paleozoic units, but little or no deformation of younger strata. Specifically, vertical displacements in the post-Pennsylvanian formations, if any, are below the resolution (~15 m) of the seismic data, far less than expected had these faults accumulated deformation over millions of years. Our results support the assertion that recent FWB earthquakes are of induced origin; this conclusion is entirely independent of analyses correlating seismicity and wastewater injection practices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to discriminate natural and induced seismicity using classical structural geology analysis techniques.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"11","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Adv","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1701593","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701593.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"November 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"VEALW9C2","version":9,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VEALW9C2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VEALW9C2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kim and Oliver","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kim, Byung-Cheol, and Matthew E.

These top-down measurements were directly compared with region-specific bottom-up inventories that utilized current industry-reported flaring and venting volumes (reported data) and quantitative estimates of unreported venting and fugitive sources. For the 50 × 50 km measurement region near Red Deer, characterized by natural gas and light oil production, measured methane fluxes were more than 17 times greater than that derived from directly reported data but consistent with our region-specific bottom-up inventory-based estimate. For the 60 × 60 km measurement region near Lloydminster, characterized by significant cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS), airborne measured methane fluxes were five times greater than directly reported emissions from venting and flaring and four times greater than our region-specific bottom up inventory-based estimate. Extended across Alberta, our results suggest that reported venting emissions in Alberta should be 2.5 ± 0.5 times higher, and total methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector (excluding mined oil sands) are likely at least 25–50% greater than current government estimates. Successful mitigation efforts in the Red Deer region will need to focus on the >90% of methane emissions currently unmeasured or unreported.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 17, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Two different impact assessment methods estimate the HTI of shale gas electricity to be 1–2 orders of magnitude less than the HTI of coal electricity (0.016–0.024 DALY/GWh versus 0.69–1.7 DALY/GWh). Further, an implausible shale gas scenario where all fracturing fluid and untreated produced water is discharged directly to surface water throughout the lifetime of a well also has a lower HTI than coal electricity. Particulate matter dominates the HTI for both systems, representing a much larger contribution to the overall toxicity burden than VOCs or any aquatic emission. Aquatic emissions can become larger contributors to the HTI when waste products are inadequately disposed or there are significant infrastructure or equipment failures.

Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock methane emissions in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock methane emissions factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. <h3>Results</h3> Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;18.2&nbsp;Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11% greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8.4% increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36.7% increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management methane emissions for 2011 in the US increased by 71.8%. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock methane emissions, (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0.05&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.05 degree resolution. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our revised bottom-up estimates of global livestock methane emissions are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual methane emissions since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock methane emissions, while not the dominant overall source of global methane emissions, may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000s to 2010s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock methane emissions from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and bottom-up estimates of methane emissions, will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments.","websiteTitle":"Carbon Balance and Management","websiteType":"OriginalPaper","date":"2017/09/29","shortTitle":"","url":"https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:21:19Z","language":"En","rights":"2017 The Author(s)","extra":"DOI: 10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"September 29, 2017","dateValue":"2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"XVNFT26H","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XVNFT26H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XVNFT26H","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Herrnstadt and Sweeney","parsedDate":"2017-09-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Herrnstadt, Evan, and Richard L.

Rapid industry expansion has also had significant and widespread impacts at the community level. This study provides an in-depth look at pre-K–12 educational impacts across six oil- and gas-producing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Colorado—to understand the benefits and challenges of the recent resource booms on student enrollment, teachers, public education finances, and student achievement metrics. Understanding the effects of such booms on public education is significant in the short and long term, notably because of their potential influence on educational achievement, career-based decisionmaking, and subsequently, the economic health of a community. A mixed-methods design, coupling difference-in-difference statistical analysis with extensive interviews, reveals a series of key insights across and within states. Broadly, we find divergent trends in student enrollment, student-teacher ratios, and per pupil revenue and expenses between school districts in the eastern versus western United States. In contrast to much of the existing literature, interviews across all regions reported minimal concern with increased dropout rates. Stress from financial uncertainty was also acute and common across all boom districts. Taken together, this analysis underscores the importance of the mixed-methods approach and cautions against overgeneralization of effects across disparate boom regions.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"August 10, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-booms-public-education-mixed-methods","accessDate":"2017-10-27","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 10, 2017","dateValue":"2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"2CYKEU8G","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2CYKEU8G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2CYKEU8G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hoy et al.","parsedDate":"2017-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hoy, Kyle A., Timothy W.

In a review of six such impact reports, Kinnaman (2011) speculates about several major issues worth scrutiny arising with analysis using input-output models. His central critique focuses on the assumptions of how industry spending is represented and how leasing and royalty dollars are spent. In this study, we use detailed county records and results from a survey to directly address these assumptions, and compare our results to the findings in an economic impact study of Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania which Kinnaman critiqued. Our results, which are only about 52% of the prior study, confirm his supposition that some ex ante studies use unrealistic assumptions which lead to gross overestimates of the impacts.","publicationTitle":"Ecological Economics","volume":"138","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"178-185","date":"August 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.03.037","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915306704","accessDate":"2017-11-14T18:27:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Input-output models","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"IDAUG7DW","version":5,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IDAUG7DW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IDAUG7DW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Elliot","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Elliot, Dan. &#x201C;Oil, Gas Lines near Colorado Buildings Mapped after Firestone Explosion.&#x201D; The Denver Post, July 1, 2017. http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/30/firestone-explosion-oil-gas-lines-map/.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IDAUG7DW","version":5,"itemType":"blogPost","title":"Oil, gas lines near Colorado buildings mapped after Firestone explosion","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Elliot"}],"abstractNote":"Colorado has nearly 129,000 underground oil and gas pipelines within about 1,000 feet (300 meters) of occupied buildings, according to energy company reports ordered by the state after a fatal hous…","blogTitle":"The Denver Post","websiteType":"","date":"2017-07-01T02:39:09+00:00","url":"http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/30/firestone-explosion-oil-gas-lines-map/","accessDate":"2017-10-26T14:21:17Z","language":"","shortTitle":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"July 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"4DU34I9W","version":6,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4DU34I9W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4DU34I9W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Heal","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Heal, Geoffrey. &#x201C;Reflections&#x2014;What Would It Take to Reduce U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80 Percent by 2050?&#x201D; <i>Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</i> 11, no. 2 (July 1, 2017): 319&#x2013;35. https://doi.org/10.1093/reep/rex014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4DU34I9W","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Reflections—What Would It Take to Reduce U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80 Percent by 2050?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Heal"}],"abstractNote":"This article investigates the cost and feasibility of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.

I draw the tentative conclusion that a more limited use of renewables (less than 50 percent) together with increased use of nuclear power might be less costly.","publicationTitle":"Review of Environmental Economics and Policy","volume":"11","issue":"2","pages":"319-335","date":"2017/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rev Environ Econ Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/reep/rex014","ISSN":"1750-6816","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/11/2/319/3964517","accessDate":"2017-10-30T14:15:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"July 1, 2017","dateValue":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GPENUQ8M","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GPENUQ8M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GPENUQ8M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2017-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

This article explores global and country-specific effects of increasing global shale gas exploitation on the energy markets, on greenhouse gas emissions, and on mitigation costs. The global techno-economic partial equilibrium model POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems) is employed to compare policies which limit global warming to 2°C and baseline scenarios when the availability of shale gas is either high or low. According to the simulation results, a high availability of shale gas has rather small effects on the costs of meeting climate targets in the medium and long term. In the long term, a higher availability of shale gas increases baseline emissions of greenhouse gases for most countries and for the world, and leads to higher compliance costs for most, but not all, countries. Allowing for global trading of emission certificates does not alter these general results. In sum, these findings cast doubt on shale gas’s potential as a low-cost option for meeting ambitious global climate targets.POLICY RELEVANCEMany countries with a large shale gas resource base consider the expansion of local shale gas extraction as an option to reduce their GHG emissions. The findings in this article imply that a higher availability of shale gas in these countries might actually increase emissions and mitigation costs for these countries and also for the world. An increase in shale gas extraction may spur a switch from coal to gas electricity generation, thus lowering emissions. At the global level and for many countries, though, this effect is more than offset by a crowding out of renewable and nuclear energy carriers, and by lower energy prices, leading to higher emissions and higher mitigation costs in turn. These findings would warrant a re-evaluation of the climate strategy in most countries relying on the exploitation of shale gas to meet their climate targets.","publicationTitle":"Climate Policy","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-17","date":"April 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","ISSN":"1469-3062","shortTitle":"","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","accessDate":"2017-10-26T12:59:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"energy prices","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"mitigation costs","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"April 10, 2017","dateValue":"2017-04-10T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9M3F7ADQ","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9M3F7ADQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9M3F7ADQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hunn","parsedDate":"2017-04-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

We explored whether residential proximity to oil and gas development was associated with risk for hematologic cancers using a registry-based case-control study design. Methods Participants were 0–24 years old, living in rural Colorado, and diagnosed with cancer between 2001–2013. For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted (IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to estimate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with non-hematologic cancers. Findings Overall, ALL cases 0–24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count tertiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5–24, ALL cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1 to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035). Further adjustment for year of diagnosis increased the association. No association was found between ALL for children aged 0–4 years or NHL and IDW well counts. While our study benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population, use of cancer-controls, the limited number of ALL and NHL cases, and aggregation of ages into five year ranges, may have biased our associations toward the null. In addition, absence of information on O&G well activities, meteorology, and topography likely reduced temporal and spatial specificity in IDW well counts. Conclusion Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to known hematologic carcinogens, further study is clearly needed to substantiate both our positive and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on oil and gas development activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest (e.g. benzene) near homes, schools, and day care centers; provide age-specific residential histories; compare cases to controls without cancer; and address other potential confounders, and environmental stressors.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"e0170423","date":"Feb 15, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170423","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170423","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:33:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Benzene","type":1},{"tag":"Cancer detection and diagnosis","type":1},{"tag":"Colorado","type":1},{"tag":"Hematology","type":1},{"tag":"Leukemias","type":1},{"tag":"Lymphocytic leukemia","type":1},{"tag":"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma","type":1},{"tag":"Oils","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:33:32Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:33:32Z","dateString":"February 15, 2017","dateValue":"2017-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"X5UVGREC","version":234,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5UVGREC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5UVGREC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2017-02-09","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

These substances are widely used in, or become byproducts of unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) development and operations. Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases. More research is needed to understand the extent of these concerns in the context of UOG, but since UOG development has expanded rapidly in recent years, the need for public health prevention techniques, well-designed studies and stronger state and national regulatory standards is becoming increasingly apparent.","publicationTitle":"Reviews on Environmental Health","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1515/reveh-2017-0008","ISSN":"0048-7554","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2017-0008/reveh-2017-0008.xml?format=INT","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:52:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DeGruyter","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"BTEX","type":1},{"tag":"EDCs","type":1},{"tag":"PAHs","type":1},{"tag":"UOG","type":1},{"tag":"children","type":1},{"tag":"heavy metals","type":1},{"tag":"particulate matter","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2017","dateValue":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"FIWKX3ZP","version":16,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FIWKX3ZP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FIWKX3ZP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.S. EIA","parsedDate":"2017","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

In this paper, we quantify four leading sources: (1) state taxes levied on the value or volume of oil and gas produced; (2) local property taxes levied on the value of oil and gas property; (3) oil and gas lease revenues from state lands; and (4) oil and gas lease revenues from federal lands. We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas- producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10 percent of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1 percent to a high of nearly 40 percent (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments’ current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Resources for the Future Working Paper 16-50","institution":"","date":"November 23, 2016","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"US State and Local Oil and Gas Revenues","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/us-state-and-local-oil-and-gas-revenues","accessDate":"2016-12-29","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"November 23, 2016","dateValue":"2016-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"U6CWTW2C","version":15,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U6CWTW2C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U6CWTW2C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Siikamaki","parsedDate":"2016-10-31","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Siikamaki, Juha. &#x201C;Optimal Siting of Shale Gas Pipeline Infrastructure: Tradeoffs between Costs and Habitat Impacts.&#x201D; Resources for the Future, October 31, 2016. http://www.rff.org/events/event/2016-11/optimal-siting-shale-gas-and-oil-development.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"U6CWTW2C","version":15,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Optimal Siting of Shale Gas Pipeline Infrastructure: Tradeoffs between Costs and Habitat Impacts","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Siikamaki"}],"abstractNote":"This was the third event in a joint RFF/Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment/Stanford Natural Gas Initiative webinar series on New Research on the Science and Economics of Natural Gas.","websiteTitle":"Resources for the Future","websiteType":"","date":"2016-10-31T10:49:11-04:00","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/events/event/2016-11/optimal-siting-shale-gas-and-oil-development","accessDate":"2017-10-26T16:47:52Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"October 31, 2016","dateValue":"2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"PP77ESIK","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PP77ESIK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PP77ESIK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schwietzke et al.","parsedDate":"2016-10-05","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schwietzke, Stefan, Owen A.

Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (1984–2009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y−1 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance. A range of sensitivity tests suggests that these results are robust.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"39","pages":"10791-10796","date":"09/27/2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1522923113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10791","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:37:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 27621453","tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian inversion","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric methane","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane isotopic composition","type":1},{"tag":"methane trends","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"September 27, 2016","dateValue":"2016-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"SZRHXFS6","version":188,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rasmussen et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rasmussen, Sara G., Elizabeth L.

In 3-level adjusted models, there was an association between the highest group of the activity metric for each UNGD phase compared with the lowest group for 11 of 12 UNGD-outcome pairs: odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for the association of the pad metric with severe exacerbations to 4.4 (95% CI, 3.8-5.2) for the association of the production metric with mild exacerbations. Six of the 12 UNGD-outcome associations had increasing ORs across quartiles. Our findings were robust to increasing levels of covariate control and in sensitivity analyses that included evaluation of some possible sources of unmeasured confounding.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Residential UNGD activity metrics were statistically associated with increased risk of mild, moderate, and severe asthma exacerbations. Whether these associations are causal awaits further investigation, including more detailed exposure assessment.</p>","publicationTitle":"JAMA Internal Medicine","volume":"176","issue":"9","pages":"1334-1343","date":"2016/09/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"JAMA Intern Med","language":"en","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.2436","ISSN":"2168-6106","shortTitle":"","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2534153","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:02:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"jamanetwork.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:02:59Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:02:59Z","dateString":"September 1, 2016","dateValue":"2016-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"JVGU6AWD","version":14,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JVGU6AWD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JVGU6AWD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"PHMSA","parsedDate":"2016-04-08","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">PHMSA. &#x201C;40 CFR Parts 191 and 192: Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmissions and Gathering Pipelines; Proposed Rule.&#x201D; Federal Register Vol. 81 No. 68, April 8, 2016.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"JVGU6AWD","version":14,"itemType":"report","title":"40 CFR Parts 191 and 192: Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmissions and Gathering Pipelines; Proposed Rule","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"PHMSA"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Federal Register Vol. 81 No. 68","institution":"","date":"April 8, 2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"April 8, 2016","dateValue":"2016-04-08T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"RIXR8EMG","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RIXR8EMG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RIXR8EMG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schaefer et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03-10","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schaefer, Hinrich, Sara E.

Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate sensitive sources. We reconstruct the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4-sink caused the [CH4]-plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn’t resume to cause the renewed [CH4]-rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4-emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"aad2705","date":"2016/03/10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aad2705","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad2705","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:36:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 26966190","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"March 10, 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-10T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"U3QWVFU4","version":136,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U3QWVFU4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U3QWVFU4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Casey et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Casey, Joan A., David A.

In Pennsylvania, the number of producing wells increased from 0 in 2005 to 3,689 in 2013. Few publications have focused on unconventional natural gas development and birth outcomes.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data on 9,384 mothers linked to 10,946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System from January 2009 to January 2013. We estimated cumulative exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity with an inverse-distance squared model that incorporated distance to the mother's home; dates and durations of well pad development, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing; and production volume during the pregnancy. We used multilevel linear and logistic regression models to examine associations between activity index quartile and term birth weight, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score and small size for gestational age birth, while controlling for potential confounding variables.\nRESULTS: In adjusted models, there was an association between unconventional natural gas development activity and preterm birth that increased across quartiles, with a fourth quartile odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.9). There were no associations of activity with Apgar score, small for gestational age birth, or term birth weight (after adjustment for year). In a posthoc analysis, there was an association with physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy identified from the problem list (fourth vs. first quartile, 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.7]).\nCONCLUSION: Prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with two pregnancy outcomes, adding to evidence that unconventional natural gas development may impact health.See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B14.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"27","issue":"2","pages":"163-172","date":"Mar 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Epidemiology","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000000387","ISSN":"1531-5487","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26426945\nPMCID: PMC4738074","tags":[{"tag":"Apgar Score","type":1},{"tag":"Birth Weight","type":1},{"tag":"Cohort Studies","type":1},{"tag":"Electronic Health Records","type":1},{"tag":"Female","type":1},{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Newborn","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Small for Gestational Age","type":1},{"tag":"Linear Models","type":1},{"tag":"Logistic Models","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Maternal Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Multilevel Analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Natural Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and Gas Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy Outcome","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy, High-Risk","type":1},{"tag":"Premature Birth","type":1},{"tag":"Proportional Hazards Models","type":1},{"tag":"Residence Characteristics","type":1},{"tag":"Retrospective Studies","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z","dateString":"March 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":8,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/J86JGJNH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/J86JGJNH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Johnston et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Johnston, Jill E., Emily Werder, and Daniel Sebastian. &#x201C;Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas.&#x201D; <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> 106, no. 3 (March 2016): 550&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jill E.","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Werder"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sebastian"}],"abstractNote":"Objectives. To investigate race and poverty in areas where oil and gas wastewater disposal wells, which are used to permanently inject wastewater from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations, are permitted., Methods. With location data of oil and gas disposal wells permitted between 2007 and 2014 in the Eagle Ford area, a region of intensive fracking in southern Texas, we analyzed the racial composition of residents living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well and those farther away, adjusting for rurality and poverty, using a Poisson regression., Results. The proportion of people of color living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well was 1.3 times higher than was the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites. Adjusting for rurality, disposal wells were 2.04 times (95% confidence interval = 2.02, 2.06) as common in areas with 80% people of color or more than in majority White areas. Disposal wells are also disproportionately sited in high-poverty areas., Conclusions. Wastewater disposal wells in southern Texas are disproportionately permitted in areas with higher proportions of people of color and residents living in poverty, a pattern known as “environmental injustice.”","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"106","issue":"3","pages":"550-556","date":"2016-3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816143/","accessDate":"2018-01-31T22:01:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26794166\nPMCID: PMC4816143","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"March 2016","dateValue":"2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"I9MJHLWW","version":14,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/I9MJHLWW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/I9MJHLWW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"PITF","parsedDate":"2016-02","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">PITF, Pennsylvania. &#x201C;Governor&#x2019;s Pipeline Infrastructure Task Force Report,&#x201D; February 2016. http://files.dep.state.pa.us/ProgramIntegration/PITF/PITF%20Report%20Final.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"I9MJHLWW","version":14,"itemType":"report","title":"Governor's Pipeline Infrastructure Task Force Report","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pennsylvania","lastName":"PITF"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"Feb. 2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://files.dep.state.pa.us/ProgramIntegration/PITF/PITF%20Report%20Final.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"February 2016","dateValue":"2016-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"DMZMDZAB","version":199,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DMZMDZAB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DMZMDZAB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state’s economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework. It was determined that the oil boom, as represented by the number of rigs in the state, led to an increase in employment and wages in energy sector, as expected, but also in the rest of the economy. Oil development activity had no significant impact on agricultural wages. Both energy sector equations, employment and wage, suggest relative independence of these variables from the movements in agriculture and the rest of the economy, and being impacted mostly by the changes in energy sector itself.

Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N = 453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.007","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Fee disbursements and the local acceptance of unconventional gas development: Insights from Pennsylvania","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462961630069X","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community acceptance"},{"tag":"Pennsylvania impact fees"},{"tag":"Revenue reinvestment"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas development"}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4","XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2016","dateValue":"2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"7BWRY49P","version":14,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7BWRY49P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7BWRY49P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route. The policy implications of these findings for energy infrastructure siting controversies are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"83","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"99-108","date":"August 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.04.004","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Politics, proximity and the pipeline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515001469","accessDate":"2017-10-27T12:36:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Keystone XL","type":1},{"tag":"NIMBY","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Pipelines","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"August 1, 2015","dateValue":"2015-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"MV89TGCJ","version":186,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MV89TGCJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MV89TGCJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jemielita et al.","parsedDate":"2015-07-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jemielita, Thomas, George L.

Despite substantial increases in well drilling, the health consequences of UGOD toxicant exposure remain unclear. This study examines an association between wells and healthcare use by zip code from 2007 to 2011 in Pennsylvania. Inpatient discharge databases from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council were correlated with active wells by zip code in three counties in Pennsylvania. For overall inpatient prevalence rates and 25 specific medical categories, the association of inpatient prevalence rates with number of wells per zip code and, separately, with wells per km2 (separated into quantiles and defined as well density) were estimated using fixed-effects Poisson models. To account for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction with associations of p<0.00096 was considered statistically significant. Cardiology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with number of wells per zip code (p<0.00096) and wells per km2 (p<0.00096) while neurology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with wells per km2 (p<0.00096). Furthermore, evidence also supported an association between well density and inpatient prevalence rates for the medical categories of dermatology, neurology, oncology, and urology. These data suggest that UGOD wells, which dramatically increased in the past decade, were associated with increased inpatient prevalence rates within specific medical categories in Pennsylvania. Further studies are necessary to address healthcare costs of UGOD and determine whether specific toxicants or combinations are associated with organ-specific responses.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"7","pages":"e0131093","date":"Jul 15, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Cardiology","type":1},{"tag":"Dermatology","type":1},{"tag":"Inpatients","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Neonatology","type":1},{"tag":"Oncology","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Urology","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateString":"July 15, 2015","dateValue":"2015-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"PNWGEUG7","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Walsh and Zoback","parsedDate":"2015-06-18","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Walsh, F.

In three study areas that encompass the vast majority of the recent seismicity, we show that the increases in seismicity follow 5- to 10-fold increases in the rates of saltwater disposal. Adjacent areas where there has been relatively little saltwater disposal have had comparatively few recent earthquakes. In the areas of seismic activity, the saltwater disposal principally comes from “produced” water, saline pore water that is coproduced with oil and then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although most of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted.Keywords","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"1","issue":"5","pages":"","date":"2015-06-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1500195","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Oklahoma’s recent earthquakes and saltwater disposal","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/advances/1/5/e1500195.full.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"June 18, 2015","dateValue":"2015-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"TQUSED4M","version":132,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TQUSED4M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TQUSED4M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Stacy et al.","parsedDate":"2015-06-03","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Stacy, Shaina L., LuAnn L.

Despite frequently expressed public concern, human health studies have not kept pace. We investigated the association of proximity to UGD in the Marcellus Shale formation and perinatal outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 15,451 live births in Southwest Pennsylvania from 2007–2010. Mothers were categorized into exposure quartiles based on inverse distance weighted (IDW) well count; least exposed mothers (first quartile) had an IDW well count less than 0.87 wells per mile, while the most exposed (fourth quartile) had 6.00 wells or greater per mile. Multivariate linear (birth weight) or logistical (small for gestational age (SGA) and prematurity) regression analyses, accounting for differences in maternal and child risk factors, were performed. There was no significant association of proximity and density of UGD with prematurity. Comparison of the most to least exposed, however, revealed lower birth weight (3323 ± 558 vs 3344 ± 544 g) and a higher incidence of SGA (6.5 vs 4.8%, respectively; odds ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.10–1.63). While the clinical significance of the differences in birth weight among the exposure groups is unclear, the present findings further emphasize the need for larger studies, in regio-specific fashion, with more precise characterization of exposure over an extended period of time to evaluate the potential public health significance of UGD.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"6","pages":"e0126425","date":"Jun 3, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0126425","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126425","accessDate":"2018-03-12T13:54:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Birth","type":1},{"tag":"Birth weight","type":1},{"tag":"Diabetes mellitus","type":1},{"tag":"Gestational diabetes","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Smoking habits","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T13:54:40Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T13:54:40Z","dateString":"June 3, 2015","dateValue":"2015-06-03T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"AC3P233G","version":17,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AC3P233G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AC3P233G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.S. Energy Information Administration","parsedDate":"2015-05-28","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">U.S. Energy Information Administration. &#x201C;Crude Oil Production,&#x201D; May 28, 2015. http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbblpd_a.htm.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"AC3P233G","version":17,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Crude Oil Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"U.S. Energy Information Administration"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"May 28, 2015","shortTitle":"Crude Oil Production","url":"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbblpd_a.htm","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"May 28, 2015","dateValue":"2015-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6RMH877P","version":234,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RMH877P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RMH877P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2015-05-19","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

In North America, these unconventional domestic sources of natural gas and oil provide an opportunity to achieve energy self-sufficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when displacing coal as a source of energy in power plants. However, fugitive methane emissions in the production process may counter the benefit over coal with respect to climate change and therefore need to be well quantified. Here we demonstrate that positive methane anomalies associated with the oil and gas industries can be detected from space and that corresponding regional emissions can be constrained using satellite observations. On the basis of a mass-balance approach, we estimate that methane emissions for two of the fastest growing production regions in the United States, the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, have increased by 990 ± 650 ktCH4 yr−1 and 530 ± 330 ktCH4 yr−1 between the periods 2006–2008 and 2009–2011. Relative to the respective increases in oil and gas production, these emission estimates correspond to leakages of 10.1% ± 7.3% and 9.1% ± 6.2% in terms of energy content, calling immediate climate benefit into question and indicating that current inventories likely underestimate the fugitive emissions from Bakken and Eagle Ford.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"2","issue":"10","pages":"2014EF000265","date":"October 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Earth's Future","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2014EF000265","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EF000265/abstract","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:30:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"1610 Atmosphere","type":1},{"tag":"1616 Climate variability","type":1},{"tag":"3360 Remote sensing","type":1},{"tag":"6324 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"6615 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"fugitive emissions","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas production","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"October 1, 2014","dateValue":"2014-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"ZMZZCI6B","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZMZZCI6B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZMZZCI6B","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Newell and Raimi","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Newell, Richard G., and Daniel Raimi. &#x201C;Implications of Shale Gas Development for Climate Change.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 48, no. 15 (August 5, 2014): 8360&#x2013;68. https://doi.org/10.1021/es4046154.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"ZMZZCI6B","version":182,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Implications of Shale Gas Development for Climate Change","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Richard G.","lastName":"Newell"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raimi"}],"abstractNote":"Advances in technologies for extracting oil and gas from shale formations have dramatically increased U.S. production of natural gas. As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations. Abundant natural gas can, however, help reduce the costs of achieving GHG reduction goals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8360-8368","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Since 2008, a rapid increase in Marcellus Shale gas production has led to a commensurate rise in associated wastewater while generation of produced water from conventional oil and gas activities has continued. In this study, we assess whether disposal practices from treatment of produced waters from both shale gas and conventional operations in Pennsylvania could result in the accumulation of associated alkali earth elements. The results from our 5 study sites indicate that there was no increase in concentrations of total Ra (Ra-226) and extractable Ba, Ca, Na, or Sr in fluvial sediments downstream of the discharge outfalls (p>0.05) of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and centralized waste treatment facilities (CWTs). However, the use of road spreading of brines from conventional oil and gas wells for deicing resulted in accumulation of Ra-226 (1.2×), and extractable Sr (3.0×), Ca (5.3×), and Na (6.2×) in soil and sediment proximal to roads (p<0.05). Although this study is an important initial assessment of the impacts of these disposal practices, more work is needed to consider the environmental consequences of produced waters management.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Coal Geology","volume":"126","issue":"","pages":"162-170","date":"June 1, 2014","series":"Environmental geology and the unconventional gas revolution","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Coal Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.coal.2013.12.001","ISSN":"0166-5162","shortTitle":"Surface disposal of produced waters in western and southwestern Pennsylvania","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516213002681","accessDate":"2018-02-12T15:17:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Conventional gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental impact","type":1},{"tag":"Produced waters disposal","type":1},{"tag":"Sediment contaminant","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"June 1, 2014","dateValue":"2014-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"LWEENXVW","version":14,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LWEENXVW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LWEENXVW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Reuters","parsedDate":"2014-05-21","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

However, because of the high global warming potential of methane (CH4, the major component of NG), climate benefits from NG use depend on system leakage rates. Some recent estimates of leakage have challenged the benefits of switching from coal to NG, a large near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunity (1–3). Also, global atmospheric CH4 concentrations are on the rise, with the causes still poorly understood (4).\nMethane emissions from U.S. and Canadian natural gas systems appear larger than official estimates.\nMethane emissions from U.S. and Canadian natural gas systems appear larger than official estimates.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"343","issue":"6172","pages":"733-735","date":"2014/02/14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1247045","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/733","accessDate":"2018-01-05T14:11:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 24531957","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"February 14, 2014","dateValue":"2014-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"LER423ZV","version":192,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LER423ZV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LER423ZV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brown","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brown, Jason. &#x201C;Production of Natural Gas from Shale in Local Economies: A Resource Blessing or Curse?&#x201D; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 2014. www.kansascityfed.org.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LER423ZV","version":192,"itemType":"report","title":"Production of natural gas from shale in local economies: a resource blessing or curse?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Brown"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City","institution":"","date":"2014","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"Production of natural gas from shale in local economies: a resource blessing or curse?","url":"www.kansascityfed.org","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2014","dateValue":"2014-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"KVCH88CH","version":6,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KVCH88CH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KVCH88CH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hardy Vincent et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hardy Vincent, Carol, Laura A.

Analyses for childhood leukemia were also unremarkable (SIR for leukemia before drilling = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.06]; SIR for leukemia after drilling = 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.11]). A slightly elevated SIR was found for central nervous system tumors after drilling (SIR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25). This was because of a slight excess in those counties with the fewest number of wells.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study offers comfort concerning health effects of HF on childhood cancers.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine","volume":"55","issue":"7","pages":"796-801","date":"Jul 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J.

We used health impact assessment (HIA) to provide decision-makers with information to promote public health at a time of rapid decision making for natural gas development. We have reported that natural gas development may expose local residents to air and water contamination, industrial noise and traffic, and community changes. We have provided more than 90 recommendations for preventing or decreasing health impacts associated with these exposures. We also have reflected on the lessons learned from conducting an HIA in a politically charged environment. Finally, we have demonstrated that despite the challenges, HIA can successfully enhance public health policymaking.","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"103","issue":"6","pages":"1002-1010","date":"2013-6","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2012.301017","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698738/","accessDate":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23597363\nPMCID: PMC3698738","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z","dateString":"June 2013","dateValue":"2013-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"PPG2I4JG","version":17,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PPG2I4JG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PPG2I4JG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.S. GAO","parsedDate":"2013-02-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">U.S. GAO. &#x201C;Pipeline Permitting: Interstate and Intrastate Natural Gas Permitting Processes Include Multiple Steps, and Time Frames Vary,&#x201D; no.

Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0.4. for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells and >½ mile from wells, respectively. Cumulative cancer risks were 10 in a million and 6 in a million for residents living ≤ ½ mile and >½ mile from wells, respectively, with benzene as the major contributor to the risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk assessment can be used in HIAs to direct health risk prevention strategies. Risk management approaches should focus on reducing exposures to emissions during well completions. These preliminary results indicate that health effects resulting from air emissions during unconventional NGD warrant further study. Prospective studies should focus on health effects associated with air pollution.","publicationTitle":"The Science of the Total Environment","volume":"424","issue":"","pages":"79-87","date":"May 01, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci.

This article documents evidence that the Resource Curse extends to the individual states of the US Using a variety of specifications, regression of state GSP growth on resource intensity consistently shows a negative and significant relationship. There is evidence that crowding out of the manufacturing sector may contribute to the slower growth of resource-based economies.

This article illustrates how countries dependent on point source natural resources (those extracted from a narrow geographic or economic base, such as oil and minerals) and plantation crops are predisposed to heightened economic and social divisions and weakened institutional capacity. This in turn impedes their ability to respond effectively to shocks, which previous studies have shown to be essential for sustaining rising levels of prosperity. Analysis of data on classifications of export structure, controlling for a wide array of other potential determinants of governance, shows that point source– and coffee and cocoa–exporting countries do relatively poorly across an array of governance indicators. These governance effects are not associated simply with being a natural resource exporter. Countries with natural resource exports that are diffuse—relying primarily on livestock and agricultural produce from small family farms—do not show the same strong effects—and have had more robust growth recoveries.","publicationTitle":"The World Bank Economic Review","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"141-174","date":"January 1, 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/wber/lhi010","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Varieties of Resource Experience: Natural Resource Export Structures and the Political Economy of Economic Growth","url":"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/141.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"January 1, 2005","dateValue":"2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"59PQD5DB","version":9,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/59PQD5DB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/59PQD5DB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kunce and Morgan","parsedDate":"2005","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kunce, Mitch, and William E Morgan. &#x201C;Taxation of Oil and Gas in the United States 1970-1997.&#x201D; <i>Natural Resources Journal</i> 45 (2005): 77.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"59PQD5DB","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Taxation of Oil and Gas in the United States 1970-1997","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mitch","lastName":"Kunce"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"William E","lastName":"Morgan"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Natural Resources Journal","volume":"45","issue":"","pages":"77","date":"2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Taxation of Oil and Gas in the United States 1970-1997","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"2005","dateValue":"2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9ZXU5CTR","version":2,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9ZXU5CTR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9ZXU5CTR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bartis et al.","parsedDate":"2005","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bartis, James T., Tom LaTourrette, Lloyd Dixon, D.J.

Introduction From 1962 until 1966, waste fluids were injected into the pre-Cambrian formations northwest of Denver, Colo. Since injection started into the 12,000-ft well, earthquakes have been observed in the area. This seismic activity, although different in character, continued when injection was stopped. Consideration has been given to removal of the waste fluids from the well to reduce earthquake magnitude and frequency. This article is a case history of the well, its operation, the observed earthquakes, and a discussion of possible mechanisms. Considerable information is available in various reports. See the references for more detailed information than can be given here. Drilling and Completion The Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) disposed of waste waters by various means until 1961, when the deep waste disposal well was completed. Before the well was completed eight geologic formations were considered as possible injection reservoirs: the Hygiene sandstone, the Codell sandstone, the \"J\" sandstone, the Dakota sandstone, the Morrison formation, the Lyons formation and the Fountain formation. The hole was to be drilled to a total depth to penetrate the pre-Cambrian rocks. pre-Cambrian rocks. During drilling it was found that the potential reservoirs were tightly cemented with silica and that Cambrian was then considered as a disposal prospect. Waste disposal through wells is practiced in many states. The RMA disposal well is unique in that it is by far the deepest (12,000 ft) and in that the reservoir consists of fractures in crystalline rock as opposed to sedimentary rocks in other projects. Operating conditions of the well fall within the range of all wells. The maximum wellhead injection pressure for the RMA well was 1,100 psi during an injection rate of 300 gal/min. The greatest depth of other waste disposal wells is 7,650 ft; the maximum wellhead pressure is 400 psi, and the maximum injection rate is 700 gal/ min. During the drilling of the well, lost circulation was observed in the Lyons formation (9,582 to 9,772 ft). Eight instances of mud losses were noted. These ranged from a 10- to a 320-bbl loss. Cores indicated the formation to be fractured. The Fountain formation (9,772 to 11,880 ft) appeared to be highly fractured to a depth of 10,400 ft, with some fracturing at greater depths. Lost circulation was frequently experienced while drilling through the Fountain, mostly between 9,960 and 10,250 ft. The lowest mud loss took place at 11,080 and was the most serious one in the well, with some 1,350 bbl lost. The well was cased to 11,171 ft and subsequent drilling did not encounter lost circulation until after a core was cut in the pre-Cambrian (11,950 ft total depth).

From 1988 onward, Alaskan oil production steadily declined. The temporal characteristics of the Alaskan oil boom make for an ideal case study of the economic effects of resource booms more generally. The boom generated significant short-run economic gains that were quickly diluted by inward migration. In the long run though, the income gains may have turned into losses. These results are robust to using a variety of comparison units, including a synthetic control.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"270-275","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.10.008","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"The long-run vanity of Prudhoe Bay","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716302057","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Alaska"},{"tag":"Oil Boom"},{"tag":"Resource Curse"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"LJL5RH5Z","version":198,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LJL5RH5Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LJL5RH5Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel. &#x201C;Local Governments Literature Review (Test),&#x201D; n.d.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LJL5RH5Z","version":198,"itemType":"report","title":"Local Governments Literature Review (test)","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raimi"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["6XUSFNEU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-22T17:15:21Z","dateModified":"2018-03-22T17:15:34Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GFYN4F4X","version":203,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GFYN4F4X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GFYN4F4X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel. &#x201C;Quality of Life/Community Issue Brief,&#x201D; n.d.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GFYN4F4X","version":203,"itemType":"report","title":"Quality of Life/Community Issue Brief","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raimi"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YSJ4IBC4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-22T17:20:09Z","dateModified":"2018-03-22T17:20:18Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"33EZ558M","version":14,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/33EZ558M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/33EZ558M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rabe and Hampton","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rabe, Barry G, and Rachel L.

Revenues surge as drilling expands during booms, creating many pressures for immediate expenditure. This often sets up enormous strain during bust periods when revenues plunge as longer-term needs emerge. This paper, however, examines the small set of states that have devised unique mechanisms to prepare for future busts. It reviews two periods (1970s and 2010s) in which six oil and gas-producing states amended their state constitutions to place severance tax revenues into permanent trust funds for long-term stewardship. It examines the key political factors that prompted the formation of these funds while also considering their resilience and performance to date.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"20","issue":"","pages":"117-127","date":"10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.06.011","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Trusting in the future: The re-emergence of state trust funds in the shale era","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616301402","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy"},{"tag":"Fracking"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Severance taxes"},{"tag":"Shale"},{"tag":"Trust funds"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"9PJ4LHN5","version":18,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9PJ4LHN5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9PJ4LHN5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber et al.","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weber, Jeremy G., Yongsheng Wang, and Maxwell Chomas. &#x201C;A Quantitative Description of State-Level Taxation of Oil and Gas Production in the Continental U.S.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 96 (September 0): 289&#x2013;301. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.06.008.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9PJ4LHN5","version":18,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A quantitative description of state-level taxation of oil and gas production in the continental U.S","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy G.","lastName":"Weber"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maxwell","lastName":"Chomas"}],"abstractNote":"We provide a quantitative description of state-level taxation of oil and gas production in the continental U.S. for 2004–2013. Aggregate revenues from production taxes nearly doubled in real terms over the period, reaching $10.3 billion and accounting for 20% of tax receipts in the top ten revenue states. The average state had a tax rate of 3.6%; nationally, the average dollar of production was taxed at 4.2%. The oil-specific rate estimated for the study period is $2.4 per barrel or $5.5 per ton of carbon. Lastly, state-level tax rates are two-thirds higher in states excluding oil and gas wells from local property taxes, suggesting that the policies are substitutes for one another.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"96","issue":"","pages":"289-301","date":"9","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2016.06.008","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"A quantitative description of state-level taxation of oil and gas production in the continental U.S","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302920","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Effective rates"},{"tag":"Oil and gas taxation"},{"tag":"State policy"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"R3I8ZTQI","version":195,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R3I8ZTQI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R3I8ZTQI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Oil and gas drilling often occurs in close proximity to where people live and work, creating the potential for significant quality of life impacts. In this review, we integrate across diverse literatures to develop a holistic account of how oil and gas development might impact quality of life in host communities. Our review suggests that the potential effect of oil and gas development is complex, as it can provide economic growth for beleaguered rural areas but also degrade human health, environmental quality and have other deleterious impacts. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research.","publicationTitle":"The Extractive Industries and Society","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Extractive Industries and Society","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.exis.2017.10.009","ISSN":"2214-790X","shortTitle":"Quality of life and unconventional oil and gas development","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X17301326","accessDate":"2017-11-14T15:01:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas","type":1},{"tag":"Quality of life","type":1}],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"FMWWZFSS","version":19,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FMWWZFSS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FMWWZFSS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yücel","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Our study area consists of two counties in Pennsylvania that are home to large amounts of unconventional natural gas extraction but are otherwise isolated from other resource extraction industries or large urban areas. We deploy parametric, semi-parametric, and matching hedonic regression models that include recent quasi-experimental methods and, in contrast to previous research and much popular intuition, we fail to find robust significance that negative environmental externalities of natural gas extraction are manifested in nearby property values.

A difference-in-difference fixed effects model and a spatial modeling to incorporate spatial heterogeneity and dependence among U.S. local areas that are in close geographical proximity are employed in this study. The results show that MRE industry employment grew faster during boom periods and slower during the bust period in MRE dependent counties. MRE earnings and earnings per worker grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. The findings give evidence of negative spatial indirect spillover effects between neighboring counties’ MRE sector labor markets. An analysis of the effect of shocks in the MRE sector on the non-MRE sectors shows that in MRE dependent counties non-MRE sector employment grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. Positive shocks in the MRE sector had no effect on the manufacturing sector labor market; however, negative shocks had a positively effect. Booms in the MRE sector positively impacted the construction sector, while negatively affecting the service and retail trade sectors’ labor markets in MRE dependent counties. Finally, this study finds that male population grew faster, while female population grew slower in the MRE dependent counties.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"292-305","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.09.009","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"Local economic impact of boom and bust in mineral resource extraction in the United States: A spatial econometrics analysis","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716302434","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Boom and bust"},{"tag":"Local economic impact"},{"tag":"Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE)"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"GL8IWZUW","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GL8IWZUW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GL8IWZUW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"James and Aadland","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">James, Alex, and David Aadland. &#x201C;The Curse of Natural Resources: An Empirical Investigation of U.S. Counties.&#x201D; <i>Resource and Energy Economics</i> 33, no. 2 (May 0): 440&#x2013;53. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2010.05.006.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GL8IWZUW","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The curse of natural resources: An empirical investigation of U.S. counties","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alex","lastName":"James"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Aadland"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"33","issue":"2","pages":"440-453","date":"5","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.reseneeco.2010.05.006","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"The curse of natural resources: An empirical investigation of U.S. counties","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765510000485","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Convergence"},{"tag":"Economic growth"},{"tag":"Natural resource curse"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"ZJAVSLEC","version":15,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZJAVSLEC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZJAVSLEC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sapouckey et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Sapouckey, Sarah A., Christopher D.

Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a 23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process. Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that prenatal UOG-MIX exposures would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland. Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to approximately 3, 30, 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX from gestational day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females prior to puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX developed more dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-MIX-treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds, i.e., highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty. These results suggest that the mammary gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in unconventional oil and gas production, at exposure levels that are environmentally relevant. The impact of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.","publicationTitle":"Endocrinology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Endocrinology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1210/en.2017-00866","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/endo/advance-article/doi/10.1210/en.2017-00866/4841948","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:56:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"MYA9MSHT","version":201,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MYA9MSHT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MYA9MSHT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Less examined are communities on the periphery of such development, which experience related impacts unique to their location. Twenty-eight long-time residents from three Bakken periphery communities were interviewed to evaluate social and environmental impact perceptions, including perceived risks of place disruption. Findings suggest that whereas place meanings and identities were disrupted by the oil boom in Bakken core communities, they remain intact in these periphery communities. Findings further suggest periphery residents view their proximal location to the Bakken region as a social and economic “Goldilocks Zone:” close enough to benefit from spillover economic impacts, yet far enough away to avoid serious negative social impacts. This research extends understanding of place disruption and development impacts in energy periphery communities.","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2017.1376138","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:58:45Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"6X984E2Y","version":18,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6X984E2Y","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6X984E2Y","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

However, empirical evidence is limited. In this article, we consider the socioeconomic effects (particularly, related to poverty, employment, income, and wages) of unconventional oil and gas extraction using a national data set of U.S. counties. We use a novel between- and within-county random effects modeling strategy to capture both resource curse and boomtown dynamics. Further, we allow the effect of oil and gas development to be conditioned by county rurality. Broadly, our findings suggest that oil and gas development has very complex effects at the county level. Within-county growth in oil and gas production slightly improves most economic outcomes, but counties that specialize in oil and gas development tend to perform worse than other counties. We find that, in general, the effect of within-county oil and gas production is not significantly moderated by county rurality.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"n/a-n/a","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rural Sociology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12198","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"Fracking Fortunes","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ruso.12198/abstract","accessDate":"2017-12-18T15:46:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"IAQ3DDW5","version":189,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IAQ3DDW5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IAQ3DDW5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel. &#x201C;Human Health Issue Brief (Test),&#x201D; n.d.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IAQ3DDW5","version":189,"itemType":"report","title":"Human Health Issue Brief (test)","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raimi"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["AMEF5E5U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-22T17:09:27Z","dateModified":"2018-03-22T17:09:41Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"Q2P5XCSV","version":3,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q2P5XCSV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q2P5XCSV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brasington","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brasington, David M. &#x201C;Edge versus Center: Finding Common Ground in the Capitalization Debate.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Urban Economics</i> 52, no. 3 (November 0): 524&#x2013;41. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0094-1190(02)00532-6.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Q2P5XCSV","version":3,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Edge versus center: finding common ground in the capitalization debate","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David M.","lastName":"Brasington"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Journal of Urban Economics","volume":"52","issue":"3","pages":"524-541","date":"11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0094-1190(02)00532-6","ISSN":"0094-1190","shortTitle":"Edge versus center: finding common ground in the capitalization debate","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119002005326","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Capitalization"},{"tag":"Crime"},{"tag":"Education"},{"tag":"House price hedonic"},{"tag":"Local public goods"},{"tag":"Taxes"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"IIAJRXPX","version":3,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IIAJRXPX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IIAJRXPX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Boyce and Herbert Emery","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Boyce, John R., and J.

Our main finding is that there is an offset of about 20%, which is robust to the inclusion of control variables, the exclusion of outliers, and alternate estimation methodologies. While the impact of the offset on long-term development prospects is not clear, there is a risk of significant adjustment costs in moving to a higher level of domestic taxation once natural resources are depleted.","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Political Economy","volume":"25","issue":"4","pages":"439-446","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2009.01.003","ISSN":"0176-2680","shortTitle":"Natural resource endowments and the domestic revenue effort","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268009000068","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Domestic revenue effort"},{"tag":"Hydrocarbon revenues"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"X9D2R5RV","version":12,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X9D2R5RV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X9D2R5RV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Nguyen-Hoang, Phuong, and John Yinger. &#x201C;The Capitalization of School Quality into House Values: A Review.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Housing Economics</i> 20, no. 1 (March 0): 30&#x2013;48. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2011.02.001.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X9D2R5RV","version":12,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The capitalization of school quality into house values: A review","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Phuong","lastName":"Nguyen-Hoang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"John","lastName":"Yinger"}],"abstractNote":"This paper provides a comprehensive review of empirical studies on the capitalization of school quality into house values that have appeared since 1999. We explore their methodological innovations and capitalization results. Most studies find significant capitalization especially for educational outputs, although the magnitudes are smaller for studies with fixed-effects estimation strategies. These studies find that house values rise by below 4% for a one-standard deviation increase in student test scores. Although major conceptual and estimation challenges remain, much progress has been made on this topic.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Housing Economics","volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":"30-48","date":"3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhe.2011.02.001","ISSN":"1051-1377","shortTitle":"The capitalization of school quality into house values: A review","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137711000027","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hedonic models"},{"tag":"House prices"},{"tag":"School quality capitalization"},{"tag":"Sorting"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}},{"key":"PF7WPTTJ","version":198,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PF7WPTTJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PF7WPTTJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1–2 percentage points (a 6–11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"23-38","date":"11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.003","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"Capturing rents from natural resource abundance: Private royalties from U.S. onshore oil & gas production","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765516300355","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Mineral rights"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Oil"},{"tag":"Royalty payments"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateString":"","dateValue":"1776-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"}}]
