We analyzed 141 drinking water wells across the Appalachian Plateaus physiographic province of northeastern Pennsylvania, examining natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures with proximity to shale gas wells. Methane was detected in 82% of drinking water samples, with average concentrations six times higher for homes <1 km from natural gas wells (P = 0.0006). Ethane was 23 times higher in homes <1 km from gas wells (P = 0.0013); propane was detected in 10 water wells, all within approximately 1 km distance (P = 0.01). Of three factors previously proposed to influence gas concentrations in shallow groundwater (distances to gas wells, valley bottoms, and the Appalachian Structural Front, a proxy for tectonic deformation), distance to gas wells was highly significant for methane concentrations (P = 0.007; multiple regression), whereas distances to valley bottoms and the Appalachian Structural Front were not significant (P = 0.27 and P = 0.11, respectively). Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P < 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P < 0.005). Isotopic signatures (δ13C-CH4, δ13C-C2H6, and δ2H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas 4He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living <1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","issue":"28","pages":"11250-11255","date":"2013/07/09","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1221635110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/28/11250","accessDate":"2018-04-10T23:00:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Using detailed location data on maternal address and GIS coordinates of gas wells, this study examines singleton births to mothers residing close to a shale gas well from 2003-2010 in Pennsylvania. The introduction of drilling increased low birth weight and decreased term birth weight on average among mothers living within 2.5 km of a well compared to mothers living within 2.5 km of a future well. Adverse effects were also detected using measures such as small for gestational age and APGAR scores, while no effects on gestation periods were found. These results are robust to other measures of infant health, many changes in speciﬁcation and falsiﬁcation tests. These results do not differ across water source (i.e. public piped water vs. ground well water) and suggest that the main mechanism is air pollution from localized economic activity. These ﬁndings suggest that shale gas development poses signiﬁcant risks to human health and have policy implications for regulation of shale gas development.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"49","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:50:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:50:05Z"}},{"key":"LPSY99G5","version":508,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LPSY99G5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LPSY99G5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Tunstall","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Tunstall, Thomas. &#x201C;Recent Economic and Community Impact of Unconventional Oil and Gas Exploration and Production on South Texas Counties in the Eagle Ford Shale Area,&#x201D; n.d., 11.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LPSY99G5","version":508,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Recent Economic and Community Impact of Unconventional Oil and Gas Exploration and Production on South Texas Counties in the Eagle Ford Shale Area","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Tunstall"}],"abstractNote":"Unconventional oil and gas extraction efforts have raised the specter of the resource curse in affected communities, as has been demonstrated in other industries or geographies.

Results indicate that the number of completed oil and gas wells has had a positive impact on per-capita income to-date.

Here, we present an assessment of private well water quality in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale formation of North Texas. We evaluated samples from 100 private drinking water wells using analytical chemistry techniques. Analyses revealed that arsenic, selenium, strontium and total dissolved solids (TDS) exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant Limit (MCL) in some samples from private water wells located within 3 km of active natural gas wells. Lower levels of arsenic, selenium, strontium, and barium were detected at reference sites outside the Barnett Shale region as well as sites within the Barnett Shale region located more than 3 km from active natural gas wells. Methanol and ethanol were also detected in 29% of samples. Samples exceeding MCL levels were randomly distributed within areas of active natural gas extraction, and the spatial patterns in our data suggest that elevated constituent levels could be due to a variety of factors including mobilization of natural constituents, hydrogeochemical changes from lowering of the water table, or industrial accidents such as faulty gas well casings.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"17","pages":"10032-10040","date":"Sep 03, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In New York and Pennsylvania, the public debate about the prospect or continuation of high volume hydraulic fracturing for shale gas has revolved around its environmental impacts, particularly its effects on water quality, while taking as a given that exploitation of this new natural gas asset will produce significant economic benefits for the states’ economies. If we want to understand how this new kind of natural gas drilling will affect communities in Pennsylvania and New York, the economic impact models that have been used to project potential benefits and job creation give us only a fraction of the information we need. To fully assess the economic effects, policy makers and citizens need to understand what will drive the pace and scale of drilling and the associated boom-bust cycle. This cycle will have implications for jobs, revenues, the cumulative impact of shale gas development, and the longer-term economic development prospects for drilling regions within the Marcellus Shale area.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"34","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z"}},{"key":"NQRMSEMN","version":493,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NQRMSEMN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NQRMSEMN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Huntington","parsedDate":"2017-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Huntington, Hillard G. &#x201C;Changing the Game?: Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies,&#x201D; September 1, 2017. https://doi.org/10.2172/1411245.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"NQRMSEMN","version":493,"itemType":"report","title":"Changing the Game?: Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hillard G.","lastName":"Huntington"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"EMFReport--26, 1411245","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"2017-09-01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Changing the Game?","url":"http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1411245/","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.2172/1411245","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z"}},{"key":"6KPW6I5P","version":491,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6KPW6I5P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6KPW6I5P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cosgrove","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cosgrove, Brandan. &#x201C;The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development: A Natural Experiment along the New York and Pennsylvania Border,&#x201D; n.d., 32.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6KPW6I5P","version":491,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development: A Natural Experiment along the New York and Pennsylvania Border","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brandan","lastName":"Cosgrove"}],"abstractNote":"In the United States, the rapid increase in shale gas production has recently stimulated local economies.

In response to these calls, we have compiled a spatially-resolved inventory of changes in water consumption associated with the coal-to-gas transition in Pennsylvania at the resolution of watersheds from 2009 to 2012. Results indicate that the total water consumption of the fuel extraction and power sectors in Pennsylvania increased by 7.6 million m3 (2 Bgal) over four years. At the state and watershed scales, we compare total water consumption for the coal-to-gas transition to a case where only the water consumed across two life cycle stages of electricity generation is considered – fuel extraction and use at the power plant to generate electricity. The results for the latter indicate that water consumption decreased by over 15.1 million m3 (4 Bgal). For both cases, watershed-level results showed water consumption generally increased in watersheds with growing shale gas activity or new natural gas capacity, while it decreased with diminishing coal-fired generation. Watershed-scale water consumption from 2009 to 2012 may be reversed from a net increase to decrease (and vice versa) when the total water consumption is compared to the water consumed specifically for life cycle stages of electricity generation, reinforcing the importance of further developing spatially-resolved inventories for LCA. Focusing on the water consumption associated with only electricity generation and its fuel use does not capture the full effects of fuel extracted for use in other sectors. We suggest that spatially-explicit inventories that include multiple life cycle stages should be a critical component in the development of more comprehensive, spatial LCA methodology. Spatial differentiation in inventories is necessary to adequately characterize watershed-level impacts that can be normalized over a functional unit. The approach can be used as a complementary assessment to LCA that can inform policy-makers and investors about where energy developments may pose additional risks to water supply and availability.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cleaner Production","volume":"184","issue":"","pages":"366-374","date":"May 20, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Cleaner Production","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.217","ISSN":"0959-6526","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261830547X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:27:43Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Coal mining","type":1},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment","type":1},{"tag":"Power generation","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Water use","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:27:43Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:27:43Z"}},{"key":"AA7WYACV","version":488,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AA7WYACV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AA7WYACV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jordaan et al.","parsedDate":"2018-05-20","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jordaan, Sarah M., Lauren A.

Proponents of gas drilling point to the activity's local economic benefits yet no empirical studies have systematically documented the magnitude or distribution of economic gains. I estimate these gains for counties in Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming, three states where natural gas production expanded substantially since the late 1990s. I find that a large increase in the value of gas production caused modest increases in employment, wage and salary income, and median household income. The results suggest that each million dollars in gas production created 2.35 jobs in the county of production, which led to an annualized increase in employment that was 1.5% of the pre-boom level for the average gas boom county. Comparisons show that ex-ante estimates of the number of jobs created by developing the Fayetteville and Marcellus shale gas formations may have been too large.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"34","issue":"5","pages":"1580-1588","date":"September 1, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2011.11.013","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988311002878","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:25:44Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic growth","type":1},{"tag":"Resource extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:25:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:25:44Z"}},{"key":"X5ZVU5UN","version":484,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5ZVU5UN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5ZVU5UN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weber, Jeremy G. &#x201C;A Decade of Natural Gas Development: The Makings of a Resource Curse?&#x201D; <i>Resource and Energy Economics</i> 37 (2014): 168&#x2013;83. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2013.11.013.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X5ZVU5UN","version":484,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A decade of natural gas development: The makings of a resource curse?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy G.","lastName":"Weber"}],"abstractNote":"Many studies ﬁnd that areas more dependent on natural resources grow more slowly – a relationship known as the resource curse. For counties in the south-central U.S., I ﬁnd little evidence of an emerging curse from greater natural gas production in the 2000s. Each gas-related mining job created more than one nonmining job, indicating that counties did not become more dependent on mining as measured by employment. Increases in population largely mitigated a rise in earnings per job and crowding out. Furthermore, changes in the adult population by education level reveal that greater production did not lead to a less educated population.

We study how shale gas development affected zip code level housing values in Texas’ Barnett Shale, which splits the Dallas-Fort Worth region in half and is the most extensively developed shale formation in the U.S. We find that housing in shale zip codes appreciated more than nonshale zip codes during peak development and less afterwards, with a net positive effect of five to six percentage points from 1997 to 2013. The greater appreciation in part reflects improved local public finances: the value of natural gas rights expanded the local tax base by $82,000 per student, increasing school revenues and expenditures. Within shale zip codes, however, an extra well per square kilometer was associated with a 1.6 percentage point decrease in appreciation over the study period.","reportNumber":"ID 2467622","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2014/07/17","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Shale Gas Development and Housing Values over a Decade","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2467622","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Barnett Shale","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"property values","type":1}],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z"}},{"key":"76VR3HRJ","version":483,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/76VR3HRJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/76VR3HRJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"America's Natural Gas Alliance","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">America&#x2019;s Natural Gas Alliance. &#x201C;The Economic and Employment Contributions of Unconventional Gas Development in State Economies.&#x201D; Accessed April 10, 2018. http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/State_Unconv_Gas_Economic_Contribution_Main.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"76VR3HRJ","version":483,"itemType":"webpage","title":"The Economic and Employment Contributions of Unconventional Gas Development in State Economies","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"America's Natural Gas Alliance"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/State_Unconv_Gas_Economic_Contribution_Main.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:23:59Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:24:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:24:40Z"}},{"key":"YUXSHNZM","version":479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Maniloff and Mastromonaco","parsedDate":"2014-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Maniloff, Peter, and Ralph Mastromonaco. &#x201C;The Local Economic Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing and Determinants of Dutch Disease.&#x201D; Working Papers.

First, using government local economic data matched to highly detailed national oil and natural gas panel data, we estimate the effect that new \"fracking\" installations have on local job growth and average earnings, controlling for time-varying unobserved determinants of job growth, overall, by industry, and by region. We find that overall employment effects are substantial although smaller than some previous studies. Second, we show that shale development increases wages in manufacturing in counties with relatively tight labor markets and little prior oil and gas industry presence. Increased wages in the manufacturing sector suggests the possibility of a loss of competitiveness in some counties with shale oil and gas resources, raising the specter of a future resource curse.","reportNumber":"2014-08","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"Working Papers","place":"","institution":"Colorado School of Mines, Division of Economics and Business","date":"2014/10","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/mns/wpaper/wp201408.html","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ideas.repec.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"dutch disease","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"job growth","type":1},{"tag":"local employment","type":1},{"tag":"resource curse","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z"}},{"key":"6XQYX9BZ","version":476,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marchand and Weber","parsedDate":"2015-09-30","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Marchand, Joseph, and Jeremy Weber. &#x201C;The Labor Market and School Finance Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Teacher Quality and Student Achievement.&#x201D; Working Papers.

One of the issues of concern is the migration of oil, gas, or produced water to a groundwater aquifer resulting in contamination of drinking water. Since methane is the major component of natural gas and it can be dissolved and transported with groundwater, stray gas in aquifers has elicited attention. The initial step toward understanding the environmental impacts of oil and gas activities, such as well drilling and fracturing, is to determine the occurrence, where it is and where it came from. In this study, groundwater methane data that has been collected in response to a relatively new regulation in Colorado is analyzed. Dissolved methane was detected in 78% of groundwater wells with an average concentration of 4.0 mg/L and a range of 0–37.1 mg/L. Greater than 95% of the methane found in groundwater wells was classified as having a microbial origin, and there was minimal overlap between the C and H isotopic characterization of the produced gas and dissolved methane measured in the aquifer. Neither density of oil/gas wells nor distance to oil/gas wells had a significant impact on methane concentration suggesting other important factors were influencing methane generation and distribution. Thermogenic methane was detected in two aquifer wells indicating a potential contamination pathway from the producing formation, but microbial-origin gas was by far the predominant source of dissolved methane in the Wattenberg field.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"3","pages":"1484-1491","date":"February 4, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

However, little attention has been paid to the potentialfor groundwater contamination resulting from surface spills from storage and production facilities at active well sites. We performed a search for publically available data regarding groundwater contamination from spills at ULS. drilling sites. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) database was selected for further analysis because it was the most detailed. The majority ofspills were in Weld County, Colorado, which has the highest density of wells that used hydraulic fracturing for completion, many producing both methane gas and crude oil. We analyzed publically available data reported by operators to the COGCC regarding surface spills that impacted groundwater From July 2010 to July 2011, we noted 77 reported surface spills impacting the groundwater in Weld County, which resulted in surface spills associated with less than 0.5% of the active wells. The reported data included groundwater samples that were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, andxylene (BTEX) components of crude oil. For groundwater samples taken both within the spill excavation area and on the first reported date of sampling, the BTEX measurements exceeded National Drinking Water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in 90, 30, 12, and 8% of the samples, respectively. However, actions taken to remediate the spills were effective at reducing BJTEX levels, with at least 84% of the spills reportedly achieving remediation as of May 2012. Our analysis demonstrates that surface spills are an important route of potential groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing activities and should be a focus of programs to protect groundwater\nIMPLICATIONS: While benzene can occur naturally in groundwater sources, spills and migration of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing activities have recently been thought to be a main source of benzene contamination in groundwater. However, there is little scientific literature to support that claim. Therefore, we accessed a publically available database and tracked the number of reported surface spills with potential groundwater impact over a 1-year period. Although the number of surface spills was minimal, our analysis provides scientific evidence that benzene can contaminate groundwater sources following surface spills at active well sites.","publicationTitle":"Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)","volume":"63","issue":"4","pages":"424-432","date":"Apr 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J Air Waste Manag Assoc","language":"eng","DOI":"","ISSN":"1096-2247","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23687727","tags":[{"tag":"Benzene","type":1},{"tag":"Benzene Derivatives","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental Monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Industrial Waste","type":1},{"tag":"Toluene","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollutants, Chemical","type":1},{"tag":"Xylenes","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:09:36Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:09:36Z"}},{"key":"UWFHS7HY","version":470,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UWFHS7HY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UWFHS7HY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brown et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brown, Stephen P A, Alan J Krupnick, and Margaret A Walls. &#x201C;Natural Gas: A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future?,&#x201D; n.d., 14.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"UWFHS7HY","version":470,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Natural Gas: A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen P A","lastName":"Brown"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alan J","lastName":"Krupnick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Margaret A","lastName":"Walls"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"14","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:06:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:06:44Z"}},{"key":"X5KUUXIS","version":468,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5KUUXIS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5KUUXIS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fitzgerald and Mason","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fitzgerald, Timothy, and Charles F Mason. &#x201C;An Evaluation of the Toxicity of Hydraulic Fracturing Injectants&#x2217;,&#x201D; n.d., 40.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X5KUUXIS","version":468,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An Evaluation of the Toxicity of Hydraulic Fracturing Injectants∗","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Fitzgerald"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles F","lastName":"Mason"}],"abstractNote":"In the past 10–15 years, innovations in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have fueled a boom in the production of natural gas from geological formations that were previously unproﬁtable. The rapid deployment of fracking has been accompanied by concerns about negative externalities. In response, a regulatory regime has emerged that requires disclosure of chemical additives, but preserves a loophole by which ﬁrms can claim that such disclosure imperils “trade secrets.” To shed light on the importance of such a disclosure rule, we combine data from wells drilled in two signiﬁcant gas ﬁelds in Wyoming with disclosure data from FracFocus about injected chemicals and materials. We explore the relation between toxicity of injectants, tendency to use the trade secrets shield, and identity of the well operator and the service company that performed the frac job. Our results have implications for the impact on social net beneﬁts of the recently reported merger between two major service companies.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"40","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:06:11Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:06:11Z"}},{"key":"Z7BSD7XQ","version":466,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z7BSD7XQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z7BSD7XQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Geman and Ohana","parsedDate":"2009-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Geman, H&#xE9;lyette, and Steve Ohana. &#x201C;Forward Curves, Scarcity and Price Volatility in Oil and Natural Gas Markets.&#x201D; <i>Energy Economics</i> 31, no. 4 (July 1, 2009): 576&#x2013;85. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2009.01.014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Z7BSD7XQ","version":466,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Forward curves, scarcity and price volatility in oil and natural gas markets","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hélyette","lastName":"Geman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Ohana"}],"abstractNote":"The role of inventory in explaining the shape of the forward curve and spot price volatility in commodity markets is central in the theory of storage developed by Kaldor [Kaldor, N. (1939) \"Speculation and Economic Stability\", The Review of Economic Studies 7, 1–27] and Working [Working, H. (1949) “The theory of the price of storage”, American Economic Review, 39, 1254–1262] and has since been documented in a vast body of financial literature, including the reference paper by Fama and French [Fama, E.F. and K.R. French (1987) “Commodity futures prices: some evidence on forecast power, premiums and the theory of storage”, Journal of Business 60, 55–73] on metals. The goal of this paper is twofold: i) validate in the case of oil and natural gas the use of the slope of the forward curve as a proxy for inventory (the slope being defined in a way that filters out seasonality); ii) analyze directly for these two major commodities the relationship between inventory and price volatility. In agreement with the theory of storage, we find that: i) the negative correlation between price volatility and inventory is globally significant for crude oil; ii) this negative correlation prevails only during those periods of scarcity when the inventory is below the historical average and increases importantly during the winter periods for natural gas. Our results are illustrated by the analysis of a 15 year-database of US oil and natural gas prices and inventory.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"31","issue":"4","pages":"576-585","date":"July 1, 2009","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2009.01.014","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988309000231","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:02:07Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Convenience yield","type":1},{"tag":"Crude oil","type":1},{"tag":"Energy price volatility","type":1},{"tag":"Forward curves","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Scarcity","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:02:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:02:07Z"}},{"key":"LSQEMD59","version":462,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LSQEMD59","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LSQEMD59","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Carter and Seinfeld","parsedDate":"2012-04-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Carter, William P.

A modeling study was carried out to assess relative contributions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and individual volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrous acid (HONO) in winter ozone formation episodes in this region. The conditions of two ozone episodes, one in February 2008 and one in March 2011, were represented using a simplified box model with all pollutants present initially, but with the detailed SAPRC-07 chemical mechanism adapted for the temperature and radiation conditions arising from the high surface albedo of the snow that was present. Sensitivity calculations were conducted to assess effects of varying HONO inputs, ambient VOC speciation, and changing treatments of temperature and lighting conditions. The locations modeled were found to be quite different in VOC speciation and sensitivities to VOC and NOx emissions, with one site modeled for the 2008 episode being highly NOx-sensitive and insensitive to VOCs and HONO, and the other 2008 site and both 2011 sites being very sensitive to changes in VOC and HONO inputs. Incremental reactivity scales calculated for VOC-sensitive conditions in the UGRB predict far lower relative contributions of alkanes to ozone formation than in the traditional urban-based MIR scale and that the major contributors to ozone formation were the alkenes and the aromatics, despite their relatively small mass contributions. The reactivity scales are affected by the variable ambient VOC speciation and uncertainties in ambient HONO levels. These box model calculations are useful for indicating general sensitivities and reactivity characteristics of these winter UGRB episodes, but fully three-dimensional models will be required to assess ozone abatement strategies in the UGRB.","publicationTitle":"Atmospheric Environment","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"255-266","date":"April 1, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Atmospheric Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.12.025","ISSN":"1352-2310","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011012982","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Incremental VOC reactivity","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas production","type":1},{"tag":"SAPRC-07 mechanism","type":1},{"tag":"Upper Green River Basin","type":1},{"tag":"Winter ozone","type":1}],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:57:34Z"}},{"key":"UKFL2AHM","version":461,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UKFL2AHM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UKFL2AHM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Life Cycle Analysis of Water Use and Intensity of Oil and Gas Recovery in Wattenberg Field, Colo.&#x201D; Accessed April 10, 2018. http://cewc.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/OGJ-May-2012-Lifecycle-Analysis-of-Water-.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"UKFL2AHM","version":461,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Life cycle analysis of water use and intensity of oil and gas recovery in Wattenberg field, Colo.","creators":[],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://cewc.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/OGJ-May-2012-Lifecycle-Analysis-of-Water-.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:55:46Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED","QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:55:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:56:19Z"}},{"key":"HMPWUUCY","version":454,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HMPWUUCY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HMPWUUCY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kuwayama et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kuwayama, Yusuke, Sheila M.

Photochemical ozone production near the Earth’s surface is considered a summertime, urban phenomenon1,2,3, where hourly average ozone concentrations can exceed 150 p.p.b., compared with background values of about 50 p.p.b., and wintertime ozone concentrations in the US are usually in the range of 35–50 p.p.b. (refs 1, 2, 3). Here we report rapid, diurnal photochemical production of ozone during air temperatures as low as −17 ∘C, in the rural Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, in the vicinity of the Jonah–Pinedale Anticline natural gas field. We find that hourly average ozone concentrations rise from 10–30 p.p.b. at night to more than 140 p.p.b. shortly after solar noon, under the influence of a stagnant, high-pressure system that promotes cold temperatures, low wind speeds and limited cloudiness. Under these conditions, an intense, shallow temperature inversion develops in the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere, which traps high concentrations of ozone precursors at night. During daytime, photolytic ozone production then leads to the observed high concentrations. We suggest that similar ozone production during wintertime is probably occurring around the world under comparable industrial and meteorological conditions.","publicationTitle":"Nature Geoscience","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"120-122","date":"2009-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/ngeo415","ISSN":"1752-0908","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo415","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2009 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z"}},{"key":"A4LUKLIV","version":446,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/A4LUKLIV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/A4LUKLIV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Final Report: Uinta Basin Winter Ozone and Air Quality Study.&#x201D; Energy Dynamics Laboratory.

If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources2. The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions3,4,5,6. Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal7,8. Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energy–economy–climate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope9,10 or its coverage of greenhouse gases2. Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models11 of energy–economy–climate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from −2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from −0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy9,10.","publicationTitle":"Nature","volume":"514","issue":"7523","pages":"482-485","date":"2014-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/nature13837","ISSN":"1476-4687","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13837","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2014 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z"}},{"key":"Q87HTPTM","version":436,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q87HTPTM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q87HTPTM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gopalakrishnan, Sathya, and H.

While there is much enthusiasm surrounding the benefits from this source of energy as a potential path to energy independence, very little is known about the environmental risks associated with this exploration activity. In this paper, we present one of the first empirical studies to measure the impact of early shale exploration as capitalized into surrounding property values. Our dataset combines real estate data, shale well data and land use data in Washington County, Pennsylvania from 2008 to mid-2010 to estimate the impact of shale activity on nearby housing values using a Box-Cox hedonic specification. We find that households are adversely impacted by shale gas exploration activity, but this impact depends on the proximity and intensity of shale activity and is largely transitory in duration. While the magnitude of the overall effect of an additional shale well within one mile from the property is modest (-0.8%) this impact is heterogeneous. The effect is larger for households located close to major highways and sourced with private well water. The impacts are larger and more persistent for properties surrounded by agricultural lands.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2117932","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Is the Shale Boom a Bust for Nearby Residents?","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2117932","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z"}},{"key":"N8XDWLQ6","version":433,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/N8XDWLQ6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/N8XDWLQ6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kramer","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kramer, Bruce M. &#x201C;FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING OPERATIONS.&#x201D; <i>TEXAS TECH LAW REVIEW</i> 44 (n.d.): 26.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"N8XDWLQ6","version":433,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING OPERATIONS","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bruce M","lastName":"Kramer"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"TEXAS TECH LAW REVIEW","volume":"44","issue":"","pages":"26","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:45:40Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:45:40Z"}},{"key":"L9PNDAEM","version":429,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/L9PNDAEM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/L9PNDAEM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cathles et al.","parsedDate":"2012-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cathles, Lawrence M., Larry Brown, Milton Taam, and Andrew Hunter. &#x201C;A Commentary on &#x2018;The Greenhouse-Gas Footprint of Natural Gas in Shale Formations&#x2019; by R.W.

These points are not in dispute. However, in their recent publication in Climatic Change Letters, Howarth et al. (2011) report that their life-cycle evaluation of shale gas drilling suggests that shale gas has a larger GHG footprint than coal and that this larger footprint “undercuts the logic of its use as a bridging fuel over the coming decades”. We argue here that their analysis is seriously flawed in that they significantly overestimate the fugitive emissions associated with unconventional gas extraction, undervalue the contribution of “green technologies” to reducing those emissions to a level approaching that of conventional gas, base their comparison between gas and coal on heat rather than electricity generation (almost the sole use of coal), and assume a time interval over which to compute the relative climate impact of gas compared to coal that does not capture the contrast between the long residence time of CO2 and the short residence time of methane in the atmosphere. High leakage rates, a short methane GWP, and comparison in terms of heat content are the inappropriate bases upon which Howarth et al. ground their claim that gas could be twice as bad as coal in its greenhouse impact. Using more reasonable leakage rates and bases of comparison, shale gas has a GHG footprint that is half and perhaps a third that of coal.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"113","issue":"2","pages":"525-535","date":"2012/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0333-0","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0333-0","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:59Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:59Z"}},{"key":"6RV99VDW","version":424,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RV99VDW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RV99VDW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Howarth et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Howarth, Robert W., Renee Santoro, and Anthony Ingraffea. &#x201C;Venting and Leaking of Methane from Shale Gas Development: Response to Cathles et Al.&#x201D; <i>Climatic Change</i> 113, no. 2 (2012): 537&#x2013;49. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6RV99VDW","version":424,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Venting and leaking of methane from shale gas development: response to Cathles et al.","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Howarth"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Renee","lastName":"Santoro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ingraffea"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"113","issue":"2","pages":"537-549","date":"7/2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"Venting and leaking of methane from shale gas development","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z"}},{"key":"WJUHN3B9","version":424,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WJUHN3B9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WJUHN3B9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Howarth et al.","parsedDate":"2011-06-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Howarth, Robert W., Renee Santoro, and Anthony Ingraffea. &#x201C;Methane and the Greenhouse-Gas Footprint of Natural Gas from Shale Formations.&#x201D; <i>Climatic Change</i> 106, no. 4 (June 1, 2011): 679. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WJUHN3B9","version":424,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Methane and the greenhouse-gas footprint of natural gas from shale formations","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Howarth"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Renee","lastName":"Santoro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ingraffea"}],"abstractNote":"We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured—as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids—and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"106","issue":"4","pages":"679","date":"2011/06/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z"}},{"key":"SDV7D8IS","version":421,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SDV7D8IS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SDV7D8IS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Laurenzi and Jersey","parsedDate":"2013-05-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Laurenzi, Ian J., and Gilbert R.

The analysis employs the most extensive data set of any LCA of shale gas to date, encompassing data from actual gas production and power generation operations. Results indicate that a typical Marcellus gas life cycle yields 466 kg CO2eq/MWh (80% confidence interval: 450–567 kg CO2eq/MWh) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 224 gal/MWh (80% CI: 185–305 gal/MWh) of freshwater consumption. Operations associated with hydraulic fracturing constitute only 1.2% of the life cycle GHG emissions, and 6.2% of the life cycle freshwater consumption. These results are influenced most strongly by the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of the well and the power plant efficiency: increase in either quantity will reduce both life cycle freshwater consumption and GHG emissions relative to power generated at the plant. We conclude by comparing the life cycle impacts of Marcellus gas and U.S. coal: The carbon footprint of Marcellus gas is 53% (80% CI: 44–61%) lower than coal, and its freshwater consumption is about 50% of coal. We conclude that substantial GHG reductions and freshwater savings may result from the replacement of coal-fired power generation with gas-fired power generation.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"9","pages":"4896-4903","date":"May 7, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The potential for surface water quality degradation has been discussed in prior work, although no empirical analysis of this issue has been published. The potential for large-scale surface water quality degradation has affected regulatory approaches to shale gas development in some US states, despite the dearth of evidence. This paper conducts a large-scale examination of the extent to which shale gas development activities affect surface water quality. Focusing on the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we estimate the effect of shale gas wells and the release of treated shale gas waste by permitted treatment facilities on observed downstream concentrations of chloride (Cl−) and total suspended solids (TSS), controlling for other factors. Results suggest that (i) the treatment of shale gas waste by treatment plants in a watershed raises downstream Cl− concentrations but not TSS concentrations, and (ii) the presence of shale gas wells in a watershed raises downstream TSS concentrations but not Cl− concentrations. These results can inform future voluntary measures taken by shale gas operators and policy approaches taken by regulators to protect surface water quality as the scale of this economically important activity increases.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","issue":"13","pages":"4962-4967","date":"2013/03/26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1213871110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/13/4962","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:41:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

To further characterize the emissions of methane and non?methane hydrocarbons (propane, n?butane, i?pentane, n?pentane and benzene) around BAO, a pilot study involving automobile?based surveys was carried out during the summer of 2008. A mix of venting emissions (leaks) of raw natural gas and flashing emissions from condensate storage tanks can explain the alkane ratios we observe in air masses impacted by oil and gas operations in northeastern Colorado. Using the WRAP Phase III inventory of total volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and gas exploration, production and processing, together with flashing and venting emission speciation profiles provided by State agencies or the oil and gas industry, we derive a range of bottom?up speciated emissions for Weld County in 2008. We use the observed ambient molar ratios and flashing and venting emissions data to calculate top?down scenarios for the amount of natural gas leaked to the atmosphere and the associated methane and non?methane emissions. Our analysis suggests that the emissions of the species we measured are most likely underestimated in current inventories and that the uncertainties attached to these estimates can be as high as a factor of two.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"117","issue":"D4","pages":"","date":"February 21, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","language":"","DOI":"10.1029/2011JD016360","ISSN":"0148-0227","shortTitle":"Hydrocarbon emissions characterization in the Colorado Front Range","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011JD016360","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"NOAA","type":1},{"tag":"alkanes","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric measurements","type":1},{"tag":"benzene","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z"}},{"key":"QFXIFYW5","version":399,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QFXIFYW5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QFXIFYW5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Merrill and Schizer","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Merrill, Thomas W., and David M.

This paper therefore attempts to explain the behavior of natural gas index returns and in so doing proposes application of a pure Markov-switching volatility model whose variance is subject to shift in regime. We show that regime-switching is clearly present in the natural gas market and such should not be ignored. All ARCH effects that show up in weekly natural gas index returns data die out almost completely after allowing for Markov-switching variance. Volatility regimes identified by our model correlate well with major events affecting supply and demand for natural gas. Out-of-sample tests indicate that the regime switching model performs noticeably better than a wide range of volatility models considered regardless of evaluation criteria, thus providing a better framework for the policy maker or financial historian interested in studying factors behind the evolution of volatility and to natural gas futures traders interested in short-term volatility forecasts. As risk-hedging decisions rely critically on assumptions about volatility, policies based on the transition probabilities are likely to be more conservative.","publicationTitle":"Energy","volume":"55","issue":"","pages":"553-563","date":"June 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.082","ISSN":"0360-5442","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421300279X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Natural gas price","type":1},{"tag":"Regime-switching","type":1},{"tag":"Volatility forecasts","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z"}},{"key":"Z9L68PSA","version":394,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z9L68PSA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z9L68PSA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Flewelling and Sharma","parsedDate":"2014-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Flewelling, Samuel A., and Manu Sharma. &#x201C;Constraints on Upward Migration of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid and Brine.&#x201D; <i>Ground Water</i> 52, no. 1 (February 2014): 9&#x2013;19. https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12095.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Z9L68PSA","version":394,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Constraints on upward migration of hydraulic fracturing fluid and brine","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel A.","lastName":"Flewelling"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Sharma"}],"abstractNote":"Recent increases in the use of hydraulic fracturing (HF) to aid extraction of oil and gas from black shales have raised concerns regarding potential environmental effects associated with predictions of upward migration of HF fluid and brine. Some recent studies have suggested that such upward migration can be large and that timescales for migration can be as short as a few years. In this article, we discuss the physical constraints on upward fluid migration from black shales (e.g., the Marcellus, Bakken, and Eagle Ford) to shallow aquifers, taking into account the potential changes to the subsurface brought about by HF. Our review of the literature indicates that HF affects a very limited portion of the entire thickness of the overlying bedrock and therefore, is unable to create direct hydraulic communication between black shales and shallow aquifers via induced fractures. As a result, upward migration of HF fluid and brine is controlled by preexisting hydraulic gradients and bedrock permeability. We show that in cases where there is an upward gradient, permeability is low, upward flow rates are low, and mean travel times are long (often >10⁶  years). Consequently, the recently proposed rapid upward migration of brine and HF fluid, predicted to occur as a result of increased HF activity, does not appear to be physically plausible. Unrealistically high estimates of upward flow are the result of invalid assumptions about HF and the hydrogeology of sedimentary basins.","publicationTitle":"Ground Water","volume":"52","issue":"1","pages":"9-19","date":"2014 Jan-Feb","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ground Water","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1111/gwat.12095","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23895673\nPMCID: PMC4321062","tags":[{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Permeability","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1},{"tag":"Water Movements","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollution, Chemical","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z"}},{"key":"LPKVL64R","version":391,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LPKVL64R","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LPKVL64R","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;01_Pavillion WY Area Domestic Water Wells Draft Final Report.Pdf.&#x201D; Accessed April 10, 2018. http://deq.wyoming.gov/media/attachments/Water%20Quality/Pavillion%20Investigation/Draft%20Report/01_Pavillion%20WY%20Area%20Domestic%20Water%20Wells%20Draft%20Final%20Report.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LPKVL64R","version":391,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"01_Pavillion WY Area Domestic Water Wells Draft Final Report.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-10T20:56:11Z","url":"http://deq.wyoming.gov/media/attachments/Water%20Quality/Pavillion%20Investigation/Draft%20Report/01_Pavillion%20WY%20Area%20Domestic%20Water%20Wells%20Draft%20Final%20Report.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"01_Pavillion WY Area Domestic Water Wells Draft Final Report.pdf","md5":"77d2d564af2ffffcd66edc7e96b11fe7","mtime":1523393771843,"tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:56:11Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:56:11Z"}},{"key":"2AG9VLRB","version":390,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2AG9VLRB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2AG9VLRB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Keranen et al.","parsedDate":"2013-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Keranen, Katie M., Heather M.

The northeastern U.S., specifically the Allegheny Plateau in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, is experiencing rapid exploration. Using Pennsylvania as a proxy for regional development across the Plateau, we examine land cover change due to shale-gas exploration, with emphasis on forest fragmentation. Pennsylvania’s shale-gas development is greatest on private land, and is dominated by pads with 1–2 wells; less than 10 % of pads have five wells or more. Approximately 45–62 % of pads occur on agricultural land and 38–54 % in forest land (many in core forest on private land). Development of permits granted as of June 3, 2011, would convert at least 644–1072 ha of agricultural land and 536–894 ha of forest land. Agricultural land conversion suggests that drilling is somewhat competing with food production. Accounting for existing pads and development of all permits would result in at least 649 km of new road, which, along with pipelines, would fragment forest cover. The Susquehanna River basin (feeding the Chesapeake Bay), is most developed, with 885 pads (26 % in core forest); permit data suggests the basin will experience continued heavy development. The intensity of core forest disturbance, where many headwater streams occur, suggests that such streams should become a focus of aquatic monitoring. Given the intense development on private lands, we believe a regional strategy is needed to help guide infrastructure development, so that habitat loss, farmland conversion, and the risk to waterways are better managed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Management","volume":"49","issue":"5","pages":"1061-1075","date":"2012/05/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Management","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","ISSN":"0364-152X, 1432-1009","shortTitle":"Early Trends in Landcover Change and Forest Fragmentation Due to Shale-Gas Development in Pennsylvania","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","accessDate":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z"}},{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Davis","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Davis, Charles. &#x201C;Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 48, no. 15 (August 5, 2014): 8397&#x2013;8403. https://doi.org/10.1021/es405095y.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Davis"}],"abstractNote":"State officials responsible for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations used in the production of oil and gas resources will inevitably confront a key policy issue; that is, to what extent can statewide regulations be developed without reducing land use autonomy typically exercised by local officials? Most state regulators have historically recognized the economic importance of industry jobs and favor the adoption of uniform regulatory requirements even if these rules preempt local policymaking authority. Conversely, many local officials seek to preserve land use autonomy to provide a greater measure of protection for public health and environmental quality goals. This paper examines how public officials in three states—Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Texas—address the question of state control versus local autonomy through their efforts to shape fracking policy decisions. While local officials within Texas have succeeded in developing fracking ordinances with relatively little interference from state regulators, Colorado and Pennsylvania have adopted a tougher policy stance favoring the retention of preemptive oil and gas statutes. Key factors that account for between state differences in fracking policy decisions include the strength of home rule provisions, gubernatorial involvement, and the degree of local experience with industrial economic activities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8397-8403","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The federal Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) rules on how drilling activity can take place on federal lands essentially dicate terms, making BLM the largest “regulator” of drilling activity in the country. BLM last revised its oil and gas regulations (the Onshore Orders) in the 1980s and early 1990s, well before the recent rapid expansion of shale gas development. To date there are two rounds of proposed revisions, the first issued in 2012 and the most recent issued in May 2013, after BLM received 177,000 comments on the first round. This paper examines the 2013 proposal in several key respects, including the scope and requirements of the new proposal, the substantial changes from the 2012 proposal, and a comparison of BLM’s proposed rules with rules in states with shale gas development and significant federal land holdings, based on earlier work. We find that BLM’s proposal addresses some apparent gaps in state-level regulation and that, generally, BLM rules do not appear to impose significant requirements beyond existing state regulations, at least across the regulatory elements we analyzed and in those states with large federal land holdings.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2313246","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2313246","accessDate":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T19:08:32Z"}},{"key":"WTH7YFJL","version":363,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WTH7YFJL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WTH7YFJL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pétron et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">P&#xE9;tron, Gabrielle, Gregory J.

Drawing on the risk literature, recent opinion surveys, and case studies of regulation in eight states, we find that UGD is an emerging technology that is likely to be perceived as risky, even though the two most commonly claimed risks, water contamination and induced seismicity, appear to be controllable through competent industry and regulatory practices. Perceived risk is likely to increase as the technology is used more widely in the United States but any public outrage is likely to be attenuated because of perceived benefits and related forms of risk compensation for individuals and communities. The types of triggering events necessary for large-scale social amplification and stigmatization have not yet occurred but organized interests against UGD are becoming stronger and are exerting significant influence. It is too early to determine whether UGD will become stigmatized in the same way that nuclear power and genetically modified foods are now stigmatized in some regions of the world.","publicationTitle":"Risk Analysis","volume":"35","issue":"10","pages":"1770-1788","date":"10/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/risa.12512","ISSN":"02724332","shortTitle":"Unconventional Gas Development in the USA","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/risa.12512","accessDate":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z"}},{"key":"3KZU4U7G","version":347,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3KZU4U7G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3KZU4U7G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Peach and Starbuck","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Peach, James, and C.

Physical and chemical impacts of HVHHF include pollution by toxic synthetic chemicals, salt, and radionuclides, landscape fragmentation by wellpads, pipelines, and roads, alteration of stream and wetland hydrology, and increased truck traffic. Despite concerns about human health, there has been little study of the impacts on habitats and biota. Taxa and guilds potentially sensitive to HVHHF impacts include freshwater organisms (e.g., brook trout, freshwater mussels), fragmentation-sensitive biota (e.g., forest-interior breeding birds, forest orchids), and species with restricted geographic ranges (e.g., Wehrle's salamander, tongue-tied minnow). Impacts are potentially serious due to the rapid development of HVHHF over a large region.","publicationTitle":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","volume":"1286","issue":"","pages":"1-14","date":"May 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ann.

The project was sponsored by CER Geonuclear Corporation with the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory providing the explosives and several technical programs, such as spall measurement. Three nuclear explosives, specifically designed for this application, were detonated simultaneously in a minimum-diameter emplacement well using many commercially available components of established reliability. The explosive system performed properly under extreme temperature and pressure conditions. Emplacement and stemming operations were designed with the aim of simplifying both the emplacement and reentry, and fully containing the detonation products. An integrated command and control system was used with communication to all three explosives through a single coaxial cable. Reentry and the initial production testing have been completed. To date 98 million cubic feet at STP (2.78 x 10$sup 6$ m$sup 3$ (STP)) of chimney gas has been produced. (auth)","series":"Conference: 4.

It can also serve as a transition fuel that will allow for the shift from coal to renewable energy resources while helping to reduce the emissions of CO2, criteria pollutants, and mercury by the power sector. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. The focus of this Review is on the current understanding of these environmental issues. Drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single well pad allows access to as much as 1 square mile of shale that is located more than a mile below. [Image courtesy of Range Resources Appalachia] Advances The most common problem with well construction is a faulty seal that is emplaced to prevent gas migration into shallow groundwater. The incidence rate of seal problems in unconventional gas wells is relatively low (1 to 3%), but there is a substantial controversy whether the methane detected in private groundwater wells in the area where drilling for unconventional gas is ongoing was caused by well drilling or natural processes. It is difficult to resolve this issue because many areas have long had sources of methane unrelated to hydraulic fracturing, and pre-drilling baseline data are often unavailable. Water management for unconventional shale gas extraction is one of the key issues that will dominate environmental debate surrounding the gas industry. Reuse of produced water for hydraulic fracturing is currently addressing the concerns regarding the vast quantities of contaminants that are brought to the surface. As these well fields mature and the opportunities for wastewater reuse diminish, the need to find alternative management strategies for this wastewater will likely intensify. Outlook Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help effectively manage water-quality risks associated with unconventional gas industry today and in the future. Confidentiality requirements dictated by legal investigations combined with the expedited rate of development and the limited funding for research are major impediments to peer-reviewed research into environmental impacts. Now is the time to work on these environmental issues to avoid an adverse environmental legacy similar to that from abandoned coal mine discharges in Pennsylvania. Hydraulic fracturing, widely known as \"fracking,\" is a relatively inexpensive way to tap into what were previously inaccessible natural gas resources. Vidic et al. (p. 826) review the current status of shale gas development and discuss the possible threats to water resources. In one of the hotbeds of fracking activity, the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States, there is little evidence that additives have directly entered groundwater supplies, but the risk remains. Ensuring access to monitoring data is an important first step toward addressing any public and environmental health concerns. Unconventional natural gas resources offer an opportunity to access a relatively clean fossil fuel that could potentially lead to energy independence for some countries. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. We review the current understanding of environmental issues associated with unconventional gas extra tion. Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help manage these water-quality risks today and in the future.%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/340/6134/1235009.full.pdf","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"340","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.1235009","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:34Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:34:34Z"}},{"key":"BALPCNEU","version":284,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BALPCNEU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BALPCNEU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Vice Admiral Jon Miller","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Vice Admiral Jon Miller. &#x201C;Our New Maritime Strategy and the Fifth Fleet,&#x201D; 2015.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"BALPCNEU","version":284,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Our New Maritime Strategy and the Fifth Fleet","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Vice Admiral Jon Miller"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"2015","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:33Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:34:33Z"}},{"key":"HDD2P6ZJ","version":284,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HDD2P6ZJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HDD2P6ZJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Venkatesh et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Venkatesh, Aranya, Paulina Jaramillo, W.

Specific pathways of contamination have been identified; however, overall rates of contamination remain ambiguous. We used an archive of geochemical data collected from 1988 to 2014 to determine the sources and occurrence of groundwater methane in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of northeastern Colorado. This 60,000-km2 region has a 60-y-long history of hydraulic fracturing, with horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing beginning in 2010. Of 924 sampled water wells in the basin, dissolved methane was detected in 593 wells at depths of 20–190 m. Based on carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes and gas molecular ratios, most of this methane was microbially generated, likely within shallow coal seams. A total of 42 water wells contained thermogenic stray gas originating from underlying oil and gas producing formations. Inadequate surface casing and leaks in production casing and wellhead seals in older, vertical oil and gas wells were identified as stray gas migration pathways. The rate of oil and gas wellbore failure was estimated as 0.06% of the 54,000 oil and gas wells in the basin (lower estimate) to 0.15% of the 20,700 wells in the area where stray gas contamination occurred (upper estimate) and has remained steady at about two cases per year since 2001. These results show that wellbore barrier failure, not high-volume hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells, is the main cause of thermogenic stray gas migration in this oil- and gas-producing basin.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"July 11, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1523267113","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z"}},{"key":"3IAWKKQN","version":278,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3IAWKKQN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3IAWKKQN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Shirzaei et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Shirzaei, Manoochehr, William L.

Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to &gt;8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of &gt;1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6306/1416.full.pdf","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"353","issue":"","pages":"1416-1419","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.aag0262","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:53Z"}},{"key":"XPGQHUHH","version":278,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XPGQHUHH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XPGQHUHH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Shearer et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Shearer, Christine, John Bistline, Mason Inman, and Steven J.

They also are varied in that West Virginia is intensive in shale gas extraction, while the other two are intensive in shale oil extraction.

Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N = 453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.007","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community acceptance"},{"tag":"Pennsylvania impact fees"},{"tag":"Revenue reinvestment"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas development"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z"}},{"key":"PEC7YHC3","version":276,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PEC7YHC3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PEC7YHC3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Parker et al.","parsedDate":"2014-10-07","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Parker, Kimberly M., Teng Zeng, Jennifer Harkness, Avner Vengosh, and William A.

We explore their methodological innovations and capitalization results. Most studies find significant capitalization especially for educational outputs, although the magnitudes are smaller for studies with fixed-effects estimation strategies. These studies find that house values rise by below 4% for a one-standard deviation increase in student test scores. Although major conceptual and estimation challenges remain, much progress has been made on this topic.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Housing Economics","volume":"20","issue":"","pages":"30-48","date":"3// 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2011.02.001","ISSN":"1051-1377","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hedonic models"},{"tag":"House prices"},{"tag":"School quality capitalization"},{"tag":"Sorting"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:18Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:18Z"}},{"key":"I4PVCISH","version":275,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/I4PVCISH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/I4PVCISH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"North Dakota Industrial Commission","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Exploration, drilling and extraction are associated with direct increases in employment and income in the energy industry, but little is known about the impacts on other parts of local economies. Increased energy sector employment and income can have positive spillover effects through increased purchases of intermediate goods and induced local spending. Negative spillover effects can occur through rising local factor and goods prices and adverse effects on the local area quality of life. Therefore, this paper examines the net economic impacts of oil and gas production from shale formations for key shale oil and gas producing areas in Arkansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is used to establish a baseline projection for the local economies in the absence of increased energy development, allowing for estimation of the net regional economic effects of increased shale oil and gas production.","publicationTitle":"Regional Science and Urban Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"forthcoming","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2014.10.006","ISSN":"0166-0462","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts"},{"tag":"Shale oil and gas"},{"tag":"Synthetic control method"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:12Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:12Z"}},{"key":"JGRAGVRB","version":274,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JGRAGVRB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JGRAGVRB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Nicholas Z.

Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are ∼2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 ± 3% of national emissions. The spatial patterns of our emission fluxes and observed methane–propane correlations indicate that fossil fuel extraction and refining are major contributors (45 ± 13%) in the south-central United States. This result suggests that regional methane emissions due to fossil fuel extraction and processing could be 4.9 ± 2.6 times larger than in EDGAR, the most comprehensive global methane inventory. These results cast doubt on the US EPA’s recent decision to downscale its estimate of national natural gas emissions by 25–30%. Overall, we conclude that methane emissions associated with both the animal husbandry and fossil fuel industries have larger greenhouse gas impacts than indicated by existing inventories.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"November 25, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1314392110","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:07Z"}},{"key":"B9SJIZTJ","version":273,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/B9SJIZTJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/B9SJIZTJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mark P.

While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state’s economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework. It was determined that the oil boom, as represented by the number of rigs in the state, led to an increase in employment and wages in energy sector, as expected, but also in the rest of the economy. Oil development activity had no significant impact on agricultural wages. Both energy sector equations, employment and wage, suggest relative independence of these variables from the movements in agriculture and the rest of the economy, and being impacted mostly by the changes in energy sector itself. Seasonality does not play significant role in energy sector employment and wages unlike in agriculture and the rest of the economy.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.10.007","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Dutch disease"},{"tag":"employment"},{"tag":"energy boom"},{"tag":"labor market"},{"tag":"natural resource curse"},{"tag":"oil"},{"tag":"wages"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z"}},{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":273,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Michaels","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Michaels, Guy. &#x201C;The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation*.&#x201D; <i>The Economic Journal</i> 121 (2011): 31&#x2013;57. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":273,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation*","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Michaels"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"The Economic Journal","volume":"121","issue":"","pages":"31-57","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x","ISSN":"1468-0297","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z"}},{"key":"NX7A7XBG","version":273,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NX7A7XBG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NX7A7XBG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Michael Wines","parsedDate":"2016-05-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Michael Wines. &#x201C;Colorado Court Strikes Down Local Bans on Fracking.&#x201D; <i>The New York Times</i>.

We report natural gas emission rates for 1 y in the urban region of Boston, using a comprehensive atmospheric measurement and modeling framework. Continuous methane observations from four stations are combined with a high-resolution transport model to quantify the regional average emission flux, 18.5 ± 3.7 (95% confidence interval) g CH4⋅m−2⋅y−1. Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, compared with the ethane-to-methane ratio in the pipeline gas delivered to the region, demonstrate that natural gas accounted for ∼60–100% of methane emissions, depending on season. Using government statistics and geospatial data on natural gas use, we find the average fractional loss rate to the atmosphere from all downstream components of the natural gas system, including transmission, distribution, and end use, was 2.7 ± 0.6% in the Boston urban region, with little seasonal variability. This fraction is notably higher than the 1.1% implied by the most closely comparable emission inventory.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"","pages":"1941-1946","date":"February 17, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1416261112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:02Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:02Z"}},{"key":"Y52PUKML","version":273,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Y52PUKML","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Y52PUKML","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McKenzie et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McKenzie, Lisa M., Ruixin Guo, Roxana Z.

For example, groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and spillage of brine and other gas drilling-related fluids is known to occur. However, contamination of shallow potable aquifers by HVHF at depth has never been fully documented. We investigated a case where Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania caused inundation of natural gas and foam in initially potable groundwater used by several households. With comprehensive 2D gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), an unresolved complex mixture of organic compounds was identified in the aquifer. Similar signatures were also observed in flowback from Marcellus Shale gas wells. A compound identified in flowback, 2-n-Butoxyethanol, was also positively identified in one of the foaming drinking water wells at nanogram-per-liter concentrations. The most likely explanation of the incident is that stray natural gas and drilling or HF compounds were driven ∼1–3 km along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the aquifer used as a potable water source. Part of the problem may have been wastewaters from a pit leak reported at the nearest gas well pad—the only nearby pad where wells were hydraulically fractured before the contamination incident. If samples of drilling, pit, and HVHF fluids had been available, GCxGC-TOFMS might have fingerprinted the contamination source. Such evaluations would contribute significantly to better management practices as the shale gas industry expands worldwide.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 4, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1420279112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:53Z"}},{"key":"CIMU6ZW3","version":271,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CIMU6ZW3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CIMU6ZW3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Littlefield","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

This policy mix has been subject to strong criticism. It is mainly argued that RES-E schemes contribute nothing to emissions reduction and undermine the cost-effectiveness of the EU ETS. Consequently, many scholars suggest the abolition of RES-E schemes. However, this conclusion rests on quite narrow and unrealistic assumptions about the design and performance of markets and policies. This article provides a systematic and comprehensive review and discussion of possible rationales for combining the EU ETS with RES-E support schemes. The first and most important reason may be restrictions to technology development and adoption. These may be attributed to the failure of markets as well as policies, and more generally to the path dependency in socio-technical systems. Under these conditions, RES-E schemes are required to reach sufficient levels of technology development. In addition, it is highlighted that in contrast to the EU ETS RES-E support schemes may provide benefits beyond mitigating climate change.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"52","issue":"","pages":"597-607","date":"1// 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.018","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"EU emissions trading system"},{"tag":"Policy mix"},{"tag":"Renewable energies"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:49Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:49Z"}},{"key":"GCA3X69F","version":271,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GCA3X69F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GCA3X69F","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lee and Plummer","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

I examine the impact of the energy boom on the labor market by exploiting a natural experiment in the Marcellus region. In particular, I compare counties with fracking activity in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the control group of counties in New York, which imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking. I look at how the benefits to the labor demand shock are shared between industries as well as how employment and wages in related industries adjust over the course of the resource boom. The results suggest total employment and wages per job increase by 7% and 11% respectively above pre-boom levels in the three years after the boom, but decline after 4 years or more. The results also show significant positive spillovers to related sectors, such as construction, transportation, retail trade and accommodations. However, there is no evidence of the so called ‘resource curse’ crowding out employment or increasing wages in manufacturing.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.03.004","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Dutch Disease"},{"tag":"Marcellus shale"},{"tag":"labor market"},{"tag":"natural experiment"},{"tag":"panel data"},{"tag":"resource extraction"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z"}},{"key":"B3M3XFHV","version":270,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/B3M3XFHV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/B3M3XFHV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Klier and Linn","parsedDate":"2010","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Klier, Thomas, and Joshua Linn. &#x201C;The Price of Gasoline and New Vehicle Fuel Economy: Evidence from Monthly Sales Data.&#x201D; <i>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</i> 2 (2010): 134&#x2013;53.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"B3M3XFHV","version":270,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The price of gasoline and new vehicle fuel economy: evidence from monthly sales data","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Klier"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Linn"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"American Economic Journal: Economic Policy","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"134-153","date":"2010","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"1945-7731","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:44Z"}},{"key":"I87WRWDA","version":270,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/I87WRWDA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/I87WRWDA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Konschnik and Boling","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Konschnik, Katherine E., and Mark K.

Hundreds of products containing more than 750 chemicals and components are potentially used throughout the extraction process, including more than 100 known or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We hypothesized that a selected subset of chemicals used in natural gas drilling operations and also surface and ground water samples collected in a drilling-dense region of Garfield County, Colorado, would exhibit estrogen and androgen receptor activities. Water samples were collected, solid-phase extracted, and measured for estrogen and androgen receptor activities using reporter gene assays in human cell lines. Of the 39 unique water samples, 89%, 41%, 12%, and 46% exhibited estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic activities, respectively. Testing of a subset of natural gas drilling chemicals revealed novel antiestrogenic, novel antiandrogenic, and limited estrogenic activities. The Colorado River, the drainage basin for this region, exhibited moderate levels of estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activities, suggesting that higher localized activity at sites with known natural gas–related spills surrounding the river might be contributing to the multiple receptor activities observed in this water source. The majority of water samples collected from sites in a drilling-dense region of Colorado exhibited more estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or antiandrogenic activities than reference sites with limited nearby drilling operations. Our data suggest that natural gas drilling operations may result in elevated endocrine-disrupting chemical activity in surface and ground water.","publicationTitle":"Endocrinology","volume":"155","issue":"","pages":"897-907","date":"2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1210/en.2013-1697","ISSN":"0013-7227","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:40Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:40Z"}},{"key":"EYFZD9BS","version":269,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EYFZD9BS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EYFZD9BS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kassotis et al.","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kassotis, Christopher D., Kara C.

However, identifying high emitters remains a challenge. We couple 163 well measurements of methane flow rates; ethane, propane, and n-butane concentrations; isotopes of methane; and noble gas concentrations from 88 wells in Pennsylvania with synthesized data from historical documents, field investigations, and state databases. Using our databases, we (i) improve estimates of the number of abandoned wells in Pennsylvania; (ii) characterize key attributes that accompany high emitters, including depth, type, plugging status, and coal area designation; and (iii) estimate attribute-specific and overall methane emissions from abandoned wells. High emitters are best predicted as unplugged gas wells and plugged/vented gas wells in coal areas and appear to be unrelated to the presence of underground natural gas storage areas or unconventional oil/gas production. Repeat measurements over 2 years show that flow rates of high emitters are sustained through time. Our attribute-based methane emission data and our comprehensive estimate of 470,000–750,000 abandoned wells in Pennsylvania result in estimated state-wide emissions of 0.04–0.07 Mt (1012 g) CH4 per year. This estimate represents 5–8% of annual anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. Our methodology combining new field measurements with data mining of previously unavailable well attributes and numbers of wells can be used to improve methane emission estimates and prioritize cost-effective mitigation strategies for Pennsylvania and beyond.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"13636-13641","date":"November 29, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1605913113","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:38Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:38Z"}},{"key":"URDKXP88","version":269,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/URDKXP88","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/URDKXP88","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kappel and Nystrom","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kappel, William M., and Elizabeth A.

The plans contemplate 80-85% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of [similar]39.3% with [similar]82.4% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with [similar]30.9% onshore wind, [similar]19.1% offshore wind, [similar]30.7% utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), [similar]7.2% rooftop PV, [similar]7.3% concentrated solar power (CSP) with storage, [similar]1.25% geothermal power, [similar]0.37% wave power, [similar]0.14% tidal power, and [similar]3.01% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4% and 7.2% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by CSP with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide [similar]3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and [similar]2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the [similar]3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate [similar]62 000 (19 000-115 000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and [similar]46 000 (12 000-104 000) in 2050, avoiding [similar]$600 ($85-$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to [similar]3.6 (0.5-14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate [similar]$3.3 (1.9-7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving [similar]$260 (190-320) per year in energy costs ($2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by [similar]$1500 (210-6000) per year and [similar]$8300 (4700-17 600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be [similar]0.42% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be [similar]1.6% of U.S. land. Thus, 100% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.","publicationTitle":"Energy & Environmental Science","volume":"8","issue":"","pages":"2093-2117","date":"2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1039/C5EE01283J","ISSN":"1754-5692","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:34Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:34Z"}},{"key":"MCR6YIXZ","version":268,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MCR6YIXZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MCR6YIXZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jacobson and Delucchi","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jacobson, Mark Z., and Mark A.

Frohlich et al., 2016). Considering seismicity from 1935 onward, Hauksson et al. (2015) concluded that there is no evidence for significant induced activity in the greater Los Angeles region between 1935 and the present. To explore a possible association between earthquakes prior to 1935 and oil and gas production, we first revisit the historical catalog and then review contemporary oil industry activities. Although early industry activities did not induce large numbers of earthquakes, we present evidence for an association between the initial oil boom in the greater Los Angeles area and earthquakes between 1915 and 1932, including the damaging 22 June 1920 Inglewood and 8 July 1929 Whittier earthquakes. We further consider whether the 1933 Mw 6.4 Long Beach earthquake might have been induced, and show some evidence that points to a causative relationship between the earthquake and activities in the Huntington Beach oil field. The hypothesis that the Long Beach earthquake was either induced or triggered by an foreshock cannot be ruled out. Our results suggest that significant earthquakes in southern California during the early twentieth century might have been associated with industry practices that are no longer employed (i.e., production without water reinjection), and do not necessarily imply a high likelihood of induced earthquakes at the present time.Online Material: Summary of background information about the Wilmington oil field, information about revisited earthquakes between 1900 and 1935, tables of felt events, and accounts of three earthquakes.","publicationTitle":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0120160157","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z"}},{"key":"5NR2PS5E","version":267,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5NR2PS5E","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5NR2PS5E","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hough","parsedDate":"2003","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hough, James A. &#x201C;The IndiKit: The Municipal Financial Indicators Evaluation Kit.&#x201D; International City/County Management Association, 2003.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"5NR2PS5E","version":267,"itemType":"report","title":"The IndiKit: The Municipal Financial Indicators Evaluation Kit","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"James A.","lastName":"Hough"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"International City/County Management Association","institution":"","date":"2003","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:28Z"}},{"key":"4ZJ8T555","version":267,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4ZJ8T555","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4ZJ8T555","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hornbach et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hornbach, Matthew J., Madeline Jones, Monique Scales, Heather R.

Here we assess whether it is plausible that human activity caused these earthquakes. Analysis of both lake and groundwater variations near Azle shows that no significant stress changes were associated with the shallow water table before or during the earthquake sequence. In contrast, pore-pressure models demonstrate that a combination of brine production and wastewater injection near the fault generated subsurface pressures sufficient to induce earthquakes on near-critically stressed faults. On the basis of modelling results and the absence of historical earthquakes near Azle, brine production combined with wastewater disposal represent the most likely cause of recent seismicity near Azle. For assessing the earthquake cause, our research underscores the necessity of monitoring subsurface wastewater formation pressures and monitoring earthquakes having magnitudes of [sim]M2 and greater. Currently, monitoring at these levels is not standard across Texas or the United States.","publicationTitle":"Nat Commun","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"","date":"04/21/online 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms7728","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:27Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:27Z"}},{"key":"L6B5DP63","version":267,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/L6B5DP63","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/L6B5DP63","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Steve Horn","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

In situ air quality measurements using membrane inlet mobile mass spectrometry revealed ambient benzene and toluene concentrations as high as 1000 and 5000 parts-per-billion, respectively, originating from specific sub-processes on unconventional oil and gas well pad sites. The detection of highly variant contamination events attributable to natural gas flaring units, condensate tanks, compressor units, and hydrogen sulfide scavengers indicates that mechanical inefficiencies, and not necessarily the inherent nature of the extraction process as a whole, result in the release of these compounds into the environment. This awareness of ongoing contamination events contributes to an enhanced knowledge of ambient volatile organic compounds on a regional scale. While these reconnaissance measurements on their own do not fully characterize the fluctuations of ambient BTEX concentrations that likely exist in the atmosphere of the Eagle Ford Shale region, they do suggest that contamination events from unconventional oil and gas development can be monitored, controlled, and reduced.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"573","issue":"","pages":"382-388","date":"12/15/ 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.118","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air quality"},{"tag":"BTEX"},{"tag":"Eagle Ford"},{"tag":"Mobile mass spectrometry"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z"}},{"key":"FDKX5C2I","version":267,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FDKX5C2I","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FDKX5C2I","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hildenbrand et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hildenbrand, Zacariah L., Doug D.

The data sources and approach used in this study differ significantly from previous efforts. The authors used inventories from the year 2009 tracking emissions of regulated air pollutants by the natural gas industry in the Barnett Shale play. These inventories were collected and screened by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). These data cover the characteristics and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of more than 16,000 individual sources in shale gas production and processing. Translating estimated emissions of VOCs into estimates of methane and carbon dioxide emissions was accomplished through the novel compilation of spatially heterogeneous gas composition analyses. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generated from Barnett Shale gas extracted in 2009 were found to be very similar to conventional natural gas and less than half those of coal-fired electricity generation.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Unconventional Oil and Gas Resources","volume":"8","issue":"","pages":"46-55","date":"12// 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juogr.2014.07.002","ISSN":"2213-3976","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment (LCA)"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Power: methane leakage"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:22Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:22Z"}},{"key":"W6W8HIAN","version":266,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/W6W8HIAN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/W6W8HIAN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Headwaters Economics","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Here we develop a five‐question test to categorize individual events as “tectonic,” “possibly induced,” “probably induced,” or “almost certainly induced.” In Texas, the probably induced and almost certainly induced earthquakes are broadly distributed geographically—in the Fort Worth basin of north Texas, the Haynesville Shale play area of east Texas, along the Gulf Coast in south Texas, and the Permian basin of west Texas. As the technologies applied to manage petroleum fields have evolved, induced earthquakes have been associated with different practices. In fields being driven by primary recovery prior to 1940, earthquakes occurred in fields extracting high volumes of petroleum from shallow strata. Subsequently, as field pressures decreased and secondary recovery technologies became common, earthquakes also occurred in association with waterflooding operations. Since 2008, the rate of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 3 has increased from about 2 events/yr to 12 events/yr; much of this change is attributable to earthquakes occurring within a few kilometers of wastewater disposal wells injecting at high monthly rates. For three sequences monitored by temporary local seismograph networks, most hypocenters had focal depths at and deeper than the depth of injection and occurred along mapped faults situated within 2 km of injection sites. The record clearly demonstrates that induced earthquakes have been broadly distributed in several different geographic parts of Texas over the last 90 years.","publicationTitle":"Seismological Research Letters","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016-05-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0220160016","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:14Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:14Z"}},{"key":"VB3G4WZK","version":265,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VB3G4WZK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VB3G4WZK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Freese","parsedDate":"2003","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Freese, Barbara. <i>Coal: A Human History</i>. 2016th ed.

Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&amp;G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&amp;G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&amp;G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (&gt; 80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&amp;G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&amp;G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"576","issue":"","pages":"138-147","date":"1/15/ 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.072","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air pollution"},{"tag":"Carcinogens"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Shale"},{"tag":"Wastewater"},{"tag":"Water contamination"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:10Z"}},{"key":"VFV8UMQG","version":264,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VFV8UMQG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VFV8UMQG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ellerman et al.","parsedDate":"2016-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ellerman, A.

First we describe the legislative development of the EU ETS, its evolution from free allocation to auctioning and centralized allocation rules, its relationship to the Kyoto Protocol and other trading systems, and its relationship to other EU climate and energy policies. This is followed by an assessment of the performance of the EU ETS, which focuses in particular on emissions, allowance prices, and the use of offsets. We conclude with a discussion of the current debate about the future of the EU ETS and proposals for changes to both the EU ETS and the climate policy environment in which it operates.

However, it is unclear whether these chemicals, injected into deep shale horizons, reach shallow groundwater aquifers and affect local water quality, either from those deep HVHF injection sites or from the surface or shallow subsurface. Here, we report detectable levels of organic compounds in shallow groundwater samples from private residential wells overlying the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. Analyses of purgeable and extractable organic compounds from 64 groundwater samples revealed trace levels of volatile organic compounds, well below the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant levels, and low levels of both gasoline range (0–8 ppb) and diesel range organic compounds (DRO; 0–157 ppb). A compound-specific analysis revealed the presence of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, which is a disclosed HVHF additive, that was notably absent in a representative geogenic water sample and field blanks. Pairing these analyses with (i) inorganic chemical fingerprinting of deep saline groundwater, (ii) characteristic noble gas isotopes, and (iii) spatial relationships between active shale gas extraction wells and wells with disclosed environmental health and safety violations, we differentiate between a chemical signature associated with naturally occurring saline groundwater and one associated with alternative anthropogenic routes from the surface (e.g., accidental spills or leaks). The data support a transport mechanism of DRO to groundwater via accidental release of fracturing fluid chemicals derived from the surface rather than subsurface flow of these fluids from the underlying shale formation.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 12, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1511474112","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:09Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:09Z"}},{"key":"AGDAHWFV","version":263,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AGDAHWFV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AGDAHWFV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Doucette","parsedDate":"2002","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Our study area consists of two counties in Pennsylvania that are home to large amounts of unconventional natural gas extraction but are otherwise isolated from other resource extraction industries or large urban areas. We deploy parametric, semi-parametric, and matching hedonic regression models that include recent quasi-experimental methods and, in contrast to previous research and much popular intuition, we fail to find robust significance that negative environmental externalities of natural gas extraction are manifested in nearby property values. While there may be plausible risks associated with unconventional natural gas extraction, we do not find consistent evidence to suggest that these risks significantly affect nearby property values.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"1-22","date":"11// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.001","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental costs"},{"tag":"Hedonic analysis"},{"tag":"Marcellus Shale"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z"}},{"key":"WICIM5HV","version":263,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WICIM5HV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WICIM5HV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"DI Desktop","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">DI Desktop. &#x201C;Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale Production Query,&#x201D; 2014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WICIM5HV","version":263,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale production query","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"DI Desktop"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"2014","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z"}},{"key":"6RSI9KCN","version":263,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RSI9KCN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RSI9KCN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Dekok","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Dekok, David. &#x201C;Range Resources Faces Fine over Pennsylvania Wastewater Leak,&#x201D; 2014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6RSI9KCN","version":263,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Range Resources faces fine over Pennsylvania wastewater leak","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Dekok"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"2014","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z"}},{"key":"RMWVP7UU","version":263,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RMWVP7UU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RMWVP7UU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Alexander T.

The 23 October 2015 blowout of a well connected to the Aliso Canyon underground storage facility in California resulted in a massive release of natural gas. Analysis of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) data from dozens of plume transects from 13 research aircraft flights between 7 Nov 2015 and 13 Feb 2016 shows atmospheric leak rates of up to 60 metric tonnes of CH4 and 4.5 metric tonnes of C2H6 per hour. At its peak this blowout effectively doubled the CH4 emission rate of the entire Los Angeles Basin, and in total released 97,100 metric tonnes of methane to the atmosphere.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016-02-25 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaf2348","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z"}},{"key":"GFK9LHD3","version":263,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GFK9LHD3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GFK9LHD3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Conrad and Hool","parsedDate":"1981","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Conrad, Robert F., and Bryce Hool. &#x201C;Resource Taxation with Heterogeneous Quality and Endogenous Reserves.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Public Economics</i> 16 (1981): 17&#x2013;33. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(81)90040-2.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GFK9LHD3","version":263,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Resource taxation with heterogeneous quality and endogenous reserves","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert F.","lastName":"Conrad"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bryce","lastName":"Hool"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Journal of Public Economics","volume":"16","issue":"","pages":"17-33","date":"8// 1981","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(81)90040-2","ISSN":"0047-2727","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:05Z"}},{"key":"WBQKX84Z","version":262,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WBQKX84Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WBQKX84Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Committee on Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Committee on Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies, Committee on Earth Resources, Committee on Geological and Geotechnical Engineering, Committee on Seismology and Geodynamics; Board on Earth and Sciences and Resources, and Division on Earth and Life Studies. <i>Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies</i>.

We extend this research by examining how geographic proximity to such extraction interacts with political ideology to influence issue support. Regression analysis of data from a fall 2013 national telephone survey of United States residents reveals that as respondents’ geographic distance from areas experiencing significant development increases, political ideology becomes more strongly associated with issue support, with the liberal-partisan divide widening. Our findings support construal level theory's central premise: that people use more abstract considerations (like political ideology) the more geographically removed they are from an issue. We discuss implications for studying public opinion of energy development as well as for risk communication.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"97","issue":"","pages":"301-309","date":"10// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.07.032","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Construal level theory"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Proximity"},{"tag":"Public perception"},{"tag":"Risk communication"},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas development"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z"}},{"key":"Q5L37I2S","version":261,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q5L37I2S","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q5L37I2S","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"City of Forth Worth TX","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">City of Forth Worth TX. &#x201C;Fort Worth City Code, Chapter 15,&#x201D; 2016.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Q5L37I2S","version":261,"itemType":"report","title":"Fort Worth City Code, Chapter 15","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"City of Forth Worth TX"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z"}},{"key":"E6D6IUHT","version":261,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/E6D6IUHT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/E6D6IUHT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"City of Beaumont Water Utilities Department","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">City of Beaumont Water Utilities Department. &#x201C;Annual Water Quality Report.&#x201D; Beaumont, TX, 2015.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"E6D6IUHT","version":261,"itemType":"report","title":"Annual Water Quality Report","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"City of Beaumont Water Utilities Department"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Beaumont, TX","institution":"","date":"2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z"}},{"key":"5PLVFQLQ","version":262,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5PLVFQLQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5PLVFQLQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Clayton","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Clayton, Blake C. <i>Market Madness: A Century of Oil Panics, Crises, and Crashes</i>.

Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1–2 percentage points (a 6–11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"23-38","date":"11// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.003","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Mineral rights"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Oil"},{"tag":"Royalty payments"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z"}},{"key":"ZJI25BEE","version":260,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZJI25BEE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZJI25BEE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jason Brown","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jason Brown. &#x201C;Production of Natural Gas from Shale in Local Economies: A Resource Blessing or Curse?&#x201D; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 2014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"ZJI25BEE","version":260,"itemType":"report","title":"Production of natural gas from shale in local economies: a resource blessing or curse?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Jason Brown"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City","institution":"","date":"2014","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z"}},{"key":"5QEJ4L7J","version":260,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5QEJ4L7J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5QEJ4L7J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brown et al.","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brown, David R., Celia Lewis, and Beth I.

During the last 5 years, accelerated oilfield fluid injection has led to a sharp increase in the rate of earthquakes in some parts of North America. In the central United States, most induced seismicity is linked to deep disposal of coproduced wastewater from oil and gas extraction. In contrast, in western Canada most recent cases of induced seismicity are highly correlated in time and space with hydraulic fracturing, during which fluids are injected under high pressure during well completion to induce localized fracturing of rock. Furthermore, it appears that the maximum‐observed magnitude of events associated with hydraulic fracturing may exceed the predictions of an often‐cited relationship between the volume of injected fluid and the maximum expected magnitude. These findings have far‐reaching implications for assessment of induced‐seismicity hazards.","publicationTitle":"Seismological Research Letters","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 30, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0220150263","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:46Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:46Z"}},{"key":"V2SMEYCB","version":259,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/V2SMEYCB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/V2SMEYCB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Associated Press","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

However, there has also been confusion about the climate implications of increased use of natural gas for electric power and transportation. We propose and illustrate the use of technology warming potentials as a robust and transparent way to compare the cumulative radiative forcing created by alternative technologies fueled by natural gas and oil or coal by using the best available estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from each fuel cycle (i.e., production, transportation and use). We find that a shift to compressed natural gas vehicles from gasoline or diesel vehicles leads to greater radiative forcing of the climate for 80 or 280 yr, respectively, before beginning to produce benefits. Compressed natural gas vehicles could produce climate benefits on all time frames if the well-to-wheels CH4 leakage were capped at a level 45–70% below current estimates. By contrast, using natural gas instead of coal for electric power plants can reduce radiative forcing immediately, and reducing CH4 losses from the production and transportation of natural gas would produce even greater benefits. There is a need for the natural gas industry and science community to help obtain better emissions data and for increased efforts to reduce methane leakage in order to minimize the climate footprint of natural gas.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"109","issue":"","pages":"6435-6440","date":"April 24, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1202407109","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:44Z"}},{"key":"LSDHHKK8","version":258,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LSDHHKK8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LSDHHKK8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Allen","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

We analyze the time-evolution of radiative forcing from both natural gas and coal-based electricity generation by calculating average radiative forcing over an interval of time from greenhouse gas emissions under a range of assumptions for fugitive methane leakage, electricity generation efficiency, and delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We find that leakage rates of between 5.2% and 9.9% are required for natural gas to result in greater mean forcing than coal over the next 100 years. We show that natural gas infrastructure with modest leakage could remain in place for 1.5–2.4 times the time interval that coal generation would have persisted prior to replacement with near-zero carbon technologies before the climate benefits of replacing coal with natural gas are negated. Natural gas can serve a viable bridge away from coal-based generation if avoiding longer-term climate impacts is prioritized, fugitive methane emissions are minimized, and the large-scale transition to near-zero carbon alternatives is unlikely to happen in the near-term.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"86","issue":"","pages":"286-294","date":"November 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.07.012","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300239","accessDate":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bridge fuel","type":1},{"tag":"Carbon dioxide","type":1},{"tag":"Climate change","type":1},{"tag":"Coal","type":1},{"tag":"Methane","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","dateModified":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z"}},{"key":"6RMH877P","version":234,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RMH877P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RMH877P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2015-05-19","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

Experiments were conducted to quantify airborne emissions from twelve samples of hydraulic fracturing flowback wastewater collected in the Permian Basin, as well as the photochemical processing of these emissions leading to the formation of particulate matter. The concentration of total volatile carbon (TVC, hydrocarbons evaporating at room temperature) averaged 29 mg of carbon (C) L-1. After photochemical oxidation under high NOx conditions the amount of organic particulate matter (PM) formed per milliliter of wastewater evaporated averaged 24 µg; the amount of ammonium nitrate formed averaged 262 µg. Based on the mean PM formation observed in these experiments, the estimated formation of PM from evaporated flowback wastewater in the state of Texas is in the range of estimated PM emissions from diesel engines used in oil rigs. Evaporation of flowback wastewater, a hitherto unrecognized source of secondary pollutants, could significantly contribute to ambient PM concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 29, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"13","issue":"3","pages":"e0194203","date":"Mar 23, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203","accessDate":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.plos.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T13:53:21Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T13:53:34Z"}},{"key":"QMRC2BE9","version":215,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QMRC2BE9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QMRC2BE9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bolden et al.","parsedDate":"2018-12","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bolden, Ashley L., Kim Schultz, Katherine E.

This occurred largely because of the development of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing which allows access to fossil fuels from geologic formations that were previously not cost effective to pursue. This process is known to use greater than 1,000 chemicals such as solvents, surfactants, detergents, and biocides. In addition, a complex mixture of chemicals, including heavy metals, naturally-occurring radioactive chemicals, and organic compounds are released from the formations and can enter air and water. Compounds associated with UOG activity have been linked to adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes in humans and laboratory animal models, which is possibly due to the presence of endocrine active chemicals. Using systematic methods, electronic searches of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify studies that measured chemicals in air near sites of UOG activity. Records were screened by title and abstract, relevant articles then underwent full text review, and data were extracted from the studies. A list of chemicals detected near UOG sites was generated. Then, the potential endocrine activity of the most frequently detected chemicals was explored via searches of literature from PubMed. Evaluation of 48 studies that sampled air near sites of UOG activity identified 106 chemicals detected in two or more studies. Ethane, benzene and n-pentane were the top three most frequently detected. Twenty-one chemicals have been shown to have endocrine activity including estrogenic and androgenic activity and the ability to alter steroidogenesis. Literature also suggested that some of the air pollutants may affect reproduction, development, and neurophysiological function, all endpoints which can be modulated by hormones. These chemicals included aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mercury. These results provide a basis for prioritizing future primary studies regarding the endocrine disrupting properties of UOG air pollutants, including exposure research in wildlife and humans. Further, we recommend systematic reviews of the health impacts of exposure to specific chemicals, and comprehensive environmental sampling of a broader array of chemicals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Health","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"26","date":"2018/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","ISSN":"1476-069X","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","accessDate":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ehjournal.biomedcentral.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s).","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateModified":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z"}},{"key":"D62T9MXF","version":214,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/D62T9MXF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/D62T9MXF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cheung et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cheung, Ron, Daniel Wetherell, and Stephan Whitaker. &#x201C;Induced Earthquakes and Housing Markets: Evidence from Oklahoma.&#x201D; <i>Regional Science and Urban Economics</i> 69 (March 1, 2018): 153&#x2013;66. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2018.01.004.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"D62T9MXF","version":214,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Induced earthquakes and housing markets: Evidence from Oklahoma","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Cheung"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Wetherell"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Whitaker"}],"abstractNote":"This paper examines the impact of earthquakes on residential property values using sales data from Oklahoma from 2006 to 2014.

In the region that is densely populated with oil producing facilities, many localized geohazards, such as ground subsidence and micro-earthquakes, have gone unnoticed. Here we identify the localized geohazards in West Texas, using the satellite radar interferometry from newly launched radar satellites that provide radar images freely to public for the first time, and probe the causal mechanisms of ground deformation, encompassing oil/gas production activities and subsurface geological characteristics. Based on our observations and analyses, human activities of fluid (saltwater, CO2) injection for stimulation of hydrocarbon production, salt dissolution in abandoned oil facilities, and hydrocarbon extraction each have negative impacts on the ground surface and infrastructures, including possible induced seismicity.

Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0.4. for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells and >½ mile from wells, respectively. Cumulative cancer risks were 10 in a million and 6 in a million for residents living ≤ ½ mile and >½ mile from wells, respectively, with benzene as the major contributor to the risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk assessment can be used in HIAs to direct health risk prevention strategies. Risk management approaches should focus on reducing exposures to emissions during well completions. These preliminary results indicate that health effects resulting from air emissions during unconventional NGD warrant further study. Prospective studies should focus on health effects associated with air pollution.","publicationTitle":"The Science of the Total Environment","volume":"424","issue":"","pages":"79-87","date":"May 01, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci.

We used health impact assessment (HIA) to provide decision-makers with information to promote public health at a time of rapid decision making for natural gas development. We have reported that natural gas development may expose local residents to air and water contamination, industrial noise and traffic, and community changes. We have provided more than 90 recommendations for preventing or decreasing health impacts associated with these exposures. We also have reflected on the lessons learned from conducting an HIA in a politically charged environment. Finally, we have demonstrated that despite the challenges, HIA can successfully enhance public health policymaking.","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"103","issue":"6","pages":"1002-1010","date":"2013-6","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2012.301017","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698738/","accessDate":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23597363\nPMCID: PMC3698738","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T15:00:18Z"}},{"key":"SGL9YEMA","version":154,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SGL9YEMA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SGL9YEMA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Colorado Dept. of Public Health","parsedDate":"2017-02-21","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Colorado Dept. of Public Health. &#x201C;Assessment of Potential Public Health Effects from Oil and Gas Operations in Colorado.&#x201D; Denver, CO, February 21, 2017.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"SGL9YEMA","version":154,"itemType":"report","title":"Assessment of Potential Public Health Effects from Oil and Gas Operations in Colorado","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Colorado Dept. of Public Health"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Denver, CO","institution":"","date":"Feb. 21, 2017","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:45:44Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:46:31Z"}},{"key":"RNVTJ94G","version":153,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fryzek et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fryzek, Jon, Susan Pastula, Xiaohui Jiang, and David H.

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"12","pages":"e1603021","date":"2017/12/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1603021","ISSN":"2375-2548","shortTitle":"Hydraulic fracturing and infant health","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1603021","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:29:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"advances.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite substantial increases in well drilling, the health consequences of UGOD toxicant exposure remain unclear. This study examines an association between wells and healthcare use by zip code from 2007 to 2011 in Pennsylvania. Inpatient discharge databases from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council were correlated with active wells by zip code in three counties in Pennsylvania. For overall inpatient prevalence rates and 25 specific medical categories, the association of inpatient prevalence rates with number of wells per zip code and, separately, with wells per km2 (separated into quantiles and defined as well density) were estimated using fixed-effects Poisson models. To account for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction with associations of p<0.00096 was considered statistically significant. Cardiology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with number of wells per zip code (p<0.00096) and wells per km2 (p<0.00096) while neurology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with wells per km2 (p<0.00096). Furthermore, evidence also supported an association between well density and inpatient prevalence rates for the medical categories of dermatology, neurology, oncology, and urology. These data suggest that UGOD wells, which dramatically increased in the past decade, were associated with increased inpatient prevalence rates within specific medical categories in Pennsylvania. Further studies are necessary to address healthcare costs of UGOD and determine whether specific toxicants or combinations are associated with organ-specific responses.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"7","pages":"e0131093","date":"Jul 15, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Cardiology","type":1},{"tag":"Dermatology","type":1},{"tag":"Inpatients","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Neonatology","type":1},{"tag":"Oncology","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Urology","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z"}},{"key":"SZRHXFS6","version":188,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SZRHXFS6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rasmussen et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rasmussen, Sara G., Elizabeth L.

In Pennsylvania, the number of producing wells increased from 0 in 2005 to 3,689 in 2013. Few publications have focused on unconventional natural gas development and birth outcomes.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data on 9,384 mothers linked to 10,946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System from January 2009 to January 2013. We estimated cumulative exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity with an inverse-distance squared model that incorporated distance to the mother's home; dates and durations of well pad development, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing; and production volume during the pregnancy. We used multilevel linear and logistic regression models to examine associations between activity index quartile and term birth weight, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score and small size for gestational age birth, while controlling for potential confounding variables.\nRESULTS: In adjusted models, there was an association between unconventional natural gas development activity and preterm birth that increased across quartiles, with a fourth quartile odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.9). There were no associations of activity with Apgar score, small for gestational age birth, or term birth weight (after adjustment for year). In a posthoc analysis, there was an association with physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy identified from the problem list (fourth vs. first quartile, 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.7]).\nCONCLUSION: Prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with two pregnancy outcomes, adding to evidence that unconventional natural gas development may impact health.See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B14.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"27","issue":"2","pages":"163-172","date":"Mar 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Epidemiology","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000000387","ISSN":"1531-5487","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26426945\nPMCID: PMC4738074","tags":[{"tag":"Apgar Score","type":1},{"tag":"Birth Weight","type":1},{"tag":"Cohort Studies","type":1},{"tag":"Electronic Health Records","type":1},{"tag":"Female","type":1},{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Newborn","type":1},{"tag":"Infant, Small for Gestational Age","type":1},{"tag":"Linear Models","type":1},{"tag":"Logistic Models","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Maternal Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Multilevel Analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Natural Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and Gas Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy Outcome","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy, High-Risk","type":1},{"tag":"Premature Birth","type":1},{"tag":"Proportional Hazards Models","type":1},{"tag":"Residence Characteristics","type":1},{"tag":"Retrospective Studies","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:02:22Z"}},{"key":"2YMNPKR7","version":127,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2YMNPKR7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2YMNPKR7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hill","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hill, Elaine. &#x201C;Shale Gas Development and Infant Health: Evidence from Pennsylvania.&#x201D; Working Paper.

There is no standard approach to tackle this problem. The most common approach, which is known as the primary energy equivalent (PEE) approach, estimates emission reductions by computing the amount of CO2 emissions that would have been emitted from fossil fuels had renewables or nuclear energy not been used. Another approach, the Equal Share (ES) approach, estimates emission reductions based on the change in the share of non-fossil based energy. As the two approaches have some limitations, a more comprehensive approach based on index decomposition analysis (IDA) is proposed as an alternative, together with an extension to quantify substitution amongst non-fossil based sources. A comparison of the assumptions and features of all three approaches is presented. The study finds that IDA is favoured for its ability to identify policy intervention areas beyond a switch to cleaner energy and is well-suited for tracking of progress towards emission reduction targets and analysing future scenarios.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"651-662","date":"February 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.019","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517307656","accessDate":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Decarbonisation","type":1},{"tag":"Emission reductions","type":1},{"tag":"Index decomposition analysis","type":1},{"tag":"LMDI","type":1},{"tag":"Paasche index","type":1},{"tag":"Renewable energy","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z"}},{"key":"AHP68RWL","version":207,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AHP68RWL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AHP68RWL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Center for Social Research at ND State Univ.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Center for Social Research at ND State Univ. &#x201C;2012 North Dakota Statewide Housing Needs Assessment: Housing Forecast.&#x201D; Fargo, ND: North Dakota Housing Finance Agency, 2012.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"AHP68RWL","version":207,"itemType":"report","title":"2012 North Dakota Statewide Housing Needs Assessment: Housing Forecast","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Center for Social Research at ND State Univ."}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Fargo, ND","institution":"North Dakota Housing Finance Agency","date":"2012","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"2012 North Dakota Statewide Housing Needs Assessment: Housing Forecast","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"6IKC2F6M","version":207,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6IKC2F6M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6IKC2F6M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bennett and Loomis","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bennett, Ashley, and John Loomis. &#x201C;Are Housing Prices Pulled Down or Pushed Up by Fracked Oil and Gas Wells?

Rapid industry expansion has also had significant and widespread impacts at the community level. This study provides an in-depth look at pre-K–12 educational impacts across six oil- and gas-producing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Colorado—to understand the benefits and challenges of the recent resource booms on student enrollment, teachers, public education finances, and student achievement metrics. Understanding the effects of such booms on public education is significant in the short and long term, notably because of their potential influence on educational achievement, career-based decisionmaking, and subsequently, the economic health of a community. A mixed-methods design, coupling difference-in-difference statistical analysis with extensive interviews, reveals a series of key insights across and within states. Broadly, we find divergent trends in student enrollment, student-teacher ratios, and per pupil revenue and expenses between school districts in the eastern versus western United States. In contrast to much of the existing literature, interviews across all regions reported minimal concern with increased dropout rates. Stress from financial uncertainty was also acute and common across all boom districts. Taken together, this analysis underscores the importance of the mixed-methods approach and cautions against overgeneralization of effects across disparate boom regions.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"August 10, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-booms-public-education-mixed-methods","accessDate":"2017-10-27","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"4RKATZQC","version":205,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4RKATZQC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4RKATZQC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Junod et al.","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Junod, Anne N., Jeffrey B.

Less examined are communities on the periphery of such development, which experience related impacts unique to their location. Twenty-eight long-time residents from three Bakken periphery communities were interviewed to evaluate social and environmental impact perceptions, including perceived risks of place disruption. Findings suggest that whereas place meanings and identities were disrupted by the oil boom in Bakken core communities, they remain intact in these periphery communities. Findings further suggest periphery residents view their proximal location to the Bakken region as a social and economic “Goldilocks Zone:” close enough to benefit from spillover economic impacts, yet far enough away to avoid serious negative social impacts. This research extends understanding of place disruption and development impacts in energy periphery communities.","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2017.1376138","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:58:45Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9KWERTZT","version":203,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9KWERTZT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9KWERTZT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber et al.","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weber, Jeremy G, Maxwell Chomas, and Yongsheng Wang. &#x201C;How Much Do US State Governments Really Tax Oil and Gas Extraction?&#x201D; Retrieved from SSRN, 2015.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9KWERTZT","version":203,"itemType":"report","title":"How Much Do US State Governments Really Tax Oil and Gas Extraction?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy G","lastName":"Weber"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maxwell","lastName":"Chomas"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Wang"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Retrieved from SSRN","institution":"","date":"2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"How Much Do US State Governments Really Tax Oil and Gas Extraction?","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"DMZMDZAB","version":199,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DMZMDZAB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DMZMDZAB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

In three study areas that encompass the vast majority of the recent seismicity, we show that the increases in seismicity follow 5- to 10-fold increases in the rates of saltwater disposal. Adjacent areas where there has been relatively little saltwater disposal have had comparatively few recent earthquakes. In the areas of seismic activity, the saltwater disposal principally comes from “produced” water, saline pore water that is coproduced with oil and then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although most of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted.Keywords","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"1","issue":"5","pages":"","date":"2015-06-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1500195","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Oklahoma’s recent earthquakes and saltwater disposal","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/advances/1/5/e1500195.full.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"KA9DNCQ7","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KA9DNCQ7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KA9DNCQ7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Magnani et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Magnani, Maria Beatrice, Michael L.

Since 2009, earthquake activity in the CUS has increased markedly, and numerous publications suggest that this increase is primarily due to induced earthquakes caused by deep-well injection of wastewater, both flowback water from hydrofracturing operations and produced water accompanying hydrocarbon production. Alternatively, some argue that these earthquakes are natural and that the seismicity increase is a normal variation that occurs over millions of years. Our analysis shows that within the NME, faults deform both Quaternary alluvium and underlying sediments dating from Paleozoic through Tertiary, with displacement increasing with geologic unit age, documenting a long history of natural activity. In the FWB, a region of ongoing wastewater injection, basement faults show deformation of the Proterozoic and Paleozoic units, but little or no deformation of younger strata. Specifically, vertical displacements in the post-Pennsylvanian formations, if any, are below the resolution (~15 m) of the seismic data, far less than expected had these faults accumulated deformation over millions of years. Our results support the assertion that recent FWB earthquakes are of induced origin; this conclusion is entirely independent of analyses correlating seismicity and wastewater injection practices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to discriminate natural and induced seismicity using classical structural geology analysis techniques.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"11","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Adv","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1701593","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701593.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"47DJY6VU","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/47DJY6VU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/47DJY6VU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yoon et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yoon, Clara E., Yihe Huang, William L.

Introduction From 1962 until 1966, waste fluids were injected into the pre-Cambrian formations northwest of Denver, Colo. Since injection started into the 12,000-ft well, earthquakes have been observed in the area. This seismic activity, although different in character, continued when injection was stopped. Consideration has been given to removal of the waste fluids from the well to reduce earthquake magnitude and frequency. This article is a case history of the well, its operation, the observed earthquakes, and a discussion of possible mechanisms. Considerable information is available in various reports. See the references for more detailed information than can be given here. Drilling and Completion The Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) disposed of waste waters by various means until 1961, when the deep waste disposal well was completed. Before the well was completed eight geologic formations were considered as possible injection reservoirs: the Hygiene sandstone, the Codell sandstone, the \"J\" sandstone, the Dakota sandstone, the Morrison formation, the Lyons formation and the Fountain formation. The hole was to be drilled to a total depth to penetrate the pre-Cambrian rocks. pre-Cambrian rocks. During drilling it was found that the potential reservoirs were tightly cemented with silica and that Cambrian was then considered as a disposal prospect. Waste disposal through wells is practiced in many states. The RMA disposal well is unique in that it is by far the deepest (12,000 ft) and in that the reservoir consists of fractures in crystalline rock as opposed to sedimentary rocks in other projects. Operating conditions of the well fall within the range of all wells. The maximum wellhead injection pressure for the RMA well was 1,100 psi during an injection rate of 300 gal/min. The greatest depth of other waste disposal wells is 7,650 ft; the maximum wellhead pressure is 400 psi, and the maximum injection rate is 700 gal/ min. During the drilling of the well, lost circulation was observed in the Lyons formation (9,582 to 9,772 ft). Eight instances of mud losses were noted. These ranged from a 10- to a 320-bbl loss. Cores indicated the formation to be fractured. The Fountain formation (9,772 to 11,880 ft) appeared to be highly fractured to a depth of 10,400 ft, with some fracturing at greater depths. Lost circulation was frequently experienced while drilling through the Fountain, mostly between 9,960 and 10,250 ft. The lowest mud loss took place at 11,080 and was the most serious one in the well, with some 1,350 bbl lost. The well was cased to 11,171 ft and subsequent drilling did not encounter lost circulation until after a core was cut in the pre-Cambrian (11,950 ft total depth).

These substances are widely used in, or become byproducts of unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) development and operations. Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases. More research is needed to understand the extent of these concerns in the context of UOG, but since UOG development has expanded rapidly in recent years, the need for public health prevention techniques, well-designed studies and stronger state and national regulatory standards is becoming increasingly apparent.","publicationTitle":"Reviews on Environmental Health","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1515/reveh-2017-0008","ISSN":"0048-7554","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2017-0008/reveh-2017-0008.xml?format=INT","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:52:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DeGruyter","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"BTEX","type":1},{"tag":"EDCs","type":1},{"tag":"PAHs","type":1},{"tag":"UOG","type":1},{"tag":"children","type":1},{"tag":"heavy metals","type":1},{"tag":"particulate matter","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"BC9SCUSZ","version":186,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BC9SCUSZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BC9SCUSZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Caron-Beaudoin et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Caron-Beaudoin, &#xC9;lyse, Naomi Valter, Jonathan Chevrier, Pierre Ayotte, Katherine Frohlich, and Marc-Andr&#xE9; Verner. &#x201C;Gestational Exposure to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada: A Pilot Study.&#x201D; <i>Environment International</i> 110 (January 2018): 131&#x2013;38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"BC9SCUSZ","version":186,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada: A pilot study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Élyse","lastName":"Caron-Beaudoin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi","lastName":"Valter"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Chevrier"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Ayotte"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Frohlich"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marc-André","lastName":"Verner"}],"abstractNote":"Background\nNortheastern British Columbia (Canada) is an area of intense hydraulic fracturing for unconventional natural gas exploitation. There have been multiple reports of air and water contamination by volatile organic compounds in the vicinity of gas wells. Although these chemicals are known developmental toxicants, no biomonitoring effort has been carried out in the region.\nObjective\nTo evaluate gestational exposure to benzene and toluene in the Peace River Valley, Northeastern British Columbia (Canada).\nMethods\nUrine samples were collected over five consecutive days from 29 pregnant women. Metabolites of benzene (s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA)) and toluene (s-benzylmercapturic acid (S-BMA)) were measured in pooled urine samples from each participant. Levels of benzene metabolites were compared to those from the general Canadian population and from a biomonitoring study of residents from an area of active gas exploitation in Pavillion, Wyoming (USA). Levels measured in participants from the two recruitment sites, and self-identifying as Indigenous or non-Indigenous, were also compared.\nResults\nWhereas the median S-PMA level (0.18 μg/g creatinine) in our study was similar to that in the general Canadian population, the median t,t-MA level (180 μg/g creatinine) was approximately 3.5 times higher. Five women had t,t-MA levels above the biological exposure index® proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The median urinary S-BMA level in our pilot study was 7.00 μg/g creatinine. Urinary metabolite levels were slightly higher in self-identifying Indigenous women, but this difference was only statistically significant for S-PMA.\nDiscussion\nUrinary t,t-MA levels, but not S-PMA levels, measured in our study are suggestive of a higher benzene exposure in participating pregnant women from the Peace River Valley than in the general Canadian population. Given the small sample size and limitations of t,t-MA measurements (e.g., non-specificity), more extensive monitoring is warranted.","publicationTitle":"Environment International","volume":"110","issue":"","pages":"131-138","date":"January 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environment International","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022","ISSN":"0160-4120","shortTitle":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017310309","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:05:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9GDUZ58L","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Worden et al.","parsedDate":"2017-12-20","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Worden, John R., A.

Some recent estimates of leakage have challenged the benefits of switching from coal to NG, a large near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunity (1–3).

As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations. Abundant natural gas can, however, help reduce the costs of achieving GHG reduction goals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8360-8368","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In this paper, we quantify four leading sources: (1) state taxes levied on the value or volume of oil and gas produced; (2) local property taxes levied on the value of oil and gas property; (3) oil and gas lease revenues from state lands; and (4) oil and gas lease revenues from federal lands. We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas-producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10% of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1% to a high of nearly 40% (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments’ current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"112","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"12-18","date":"January 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.002","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517306250","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:32:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Resource taxation","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"ZJAVSLEC","version":15,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZJAVSLEC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZJAVSLEC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sapouckey et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Sapouckey, Sarah A., Christopher D.

Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a 23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process. Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that prenatal UOG-MIX exposures would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland. Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to approximately 3, 30, 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX from gestational day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females prior to puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX developed more dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-MIX-treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds, i.e., highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty. These results suggest that the mammary gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in unconventional oil and gas production, at exposure levels that are environmentally relevant. The impact of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.","publicationTitle":"Endocrinology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Endocrinology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1210/en.2017-00866","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/endo/advance-article/doi/10.1210/en.2017-00866/4841948","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:56:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"PPG2I4JG","version":17,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PPG2I4JG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PPG2I4JG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.S. GAO","parsedDate":"2013-02-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">U.S. GAO. &#x201C;Pipeline Permitting: Interstate and Intrastate Natural Gas Permitting Processes Include Multiple Steps, and Time Frames Vary,&#x201D; no.

Oil and gas drilling often occurs in close proximity to where people live and work, creating the potential for significant quality of life impacts. In this review, we integrate across diverse literatures to develop a holistic account of how oil and gas development might impact quality of life in host communities. Our review suggests that the potential effect of oil and gas development is complex, as it can provide economic growth for beleaguered rural areas but also degrade human health, environmental quality and have other deleterious impacts. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research.","publicationTitle":"The Extractive Industries and Society","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Extractive Industries and Society","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.exis.2017.10.009","ISSN":"2214-790X","shortTitle":"Quality of life and unconventional oil and gas development","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X17301326","accessDate":"2017-11-14T15:01:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas","type":1},{"tag":"Quality of life","type":1}],"collections":["XN7GXNFQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"JZL2CYJK","version":186,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JZL2CYJK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JZL2CYJK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Chen et al.","parsedDate":"2017-10-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Chen, Lu, Shelie A.

Two different impact assessment methods estimate the HTI of shale gas electricity to be 1–2 orders of magnitude less than the HTI of coal electricity (0.016–0.024 DALY/GWh versus 0.69–1.7 DALY/GWh). Further, an implausible shale gas scenario where all fracturing fluid and untreated produced water is discharged directly to surface water throughout the lifetime of a well also has a lower HTI than coal electricity. Particulate matter dominates the HTI for both systems, representing a much larger contribution to the overall toxicity burden than VOCs or any aquatic emission. Aquatic emissions can become larger contributors to the HTI when waste products are inadequately disposed or there are significant infrastructure or equipment failures. Large uncertainty and lack of exposure data prevent a full risk assessment; however, the results of this analysis provide a comparison of relative toxicity, which can be used to identify target areas for improvement and assess potential trade-offs with other environmental impacts.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

These top-down measurements were directly compared with region-specific bottom-up inventories that utilized current industry-reported flaring and venting volumes (reported data) and quantitative estimates of unreported venting and fugitive sources. For the 50 × 50 km measurement region near Red Deer, characterized by natural gas and light oil production, measured methane fluxes were more than 17 times greater than that derived from directly reported data but consistent with our region-specific bottom-up inventory-based estimate. For the 60 × 60 km measurement region near Lloydminster, characterized by significant cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS), airborne measured methane fluxes were five times greater than directly reported emissions from venting and flaring and four times greater than our region-specific bottom up inventory-based estimate. Extended across Alberta, our results suggest that reported venting emissions in Alberta should be 2.5 ± 0.5 times higher, and total methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector (excluding mined oil sands) are likely at least 25–50% greater than current government estimates. Successful mitigation efforts in the Red Deer region will need to focus on the >90% of methane emissions currently unmeasured or unreported.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 17, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This article explores global and country-specific effects of increasing global shale gas exploitation on the energy markets, on greenhouse gas emissions, and on mitigation costs. The global techno-economic partial equilibrium model POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems) is employed to compare policies which limit global warming to 2°C and baseline scenarios when the availability of shale gas is either high or low. According to the simulation results, a high availability of shale gas has rather small effects on the costs of meeting climate targets in the medium and long term. In the long term, a higher availability of shale gas increases baseline emissions of greenhouse gases for most countries and for the world, and leads to higher compliance costs for most, but not all, countries. Allowing for global trading of emission certificates does not alter these general results. In sum, these findings cast doubt on shale gas’s potential as a low-cost option for meeting ambitious global climate targets.POLICY RELEVANCEMany countries with a large shale gas resource base consider the expansion of local shale gas extraction as an option to reduce their GHG emissions. The findings in this article imply that a higher availability of shale gas in these countries might actually increase emissions and mitigation costs for these countries and also for the world. An increase in shale gas extraction may spur a switch from coal to gas electricity generation, thus lowering emissions. At the global level and for many countries, though, this effect is more than offset by a crowding out of renewable and nuclear energy carriers, and by lower energy prices, leading to higher emissions and higher mitigation costs in turn. These findings would warrant a re-evaluation of the climate strategy in most countries relying on the exploitation of shale gas to meet their climate targets.","publicationTitle":"Climate Policy","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-17","date":"April 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","ISSN":"1469-3062","shortTitle":"","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","accessDate":"2017-10-26T12:59:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"energy prices","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"mitigation costs","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"FVSF3SZC","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FVSF3SZC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FVSF3SZC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schneising et al.","parsedDate":"2014-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schneising, Oliver, John P.

In North America, these unconventional domestic sources of natural gas and oil provide an opportunity to achieve energy self-sufficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when displacing coal as a source of energy in power plants. However, fugitive methane emissions in the production process may counter the benefit over coal with respect to climate change and therefore need to be well quantified. Here we demonstrate that positive methane anomalies associated with the oil and gas industries can be detected from space and that corresponding regional emissions can be constrained using satellite observations. On the basis of a mass-balance approach, we estimate that methane emissions for two of the fastest growing production regions in the United States, the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, have increased by 990 ± 650 ktCH4 yr−1 and 530 ± 330 ktCH4 yr−1 between the periods 2006–2008 and 2009–2011. Relative to the respective increases in oil and gas production, these emission estimates correspond to leakages of 10.1% ± 7.3% and 9.1% ± 6.2% in terms of energy content, calling immediate climate benefit into question and indicating that current inventories likely underestimate the fugitive emissions from Bakken and Eagle Ford.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"2","issue":"10","pages":"2014EF000265","date":"October 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Earth's Future","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2014EF000265","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EF000265/abstract","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:30:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"1610 Atmosphere","type":1},{"tag":"1616 Climate variability","type":1},{"tag":"3360 Remote sensing","type":1},{"tag":"6324 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"6615 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"fugitive emissions","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas production","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"Q9PSCX83","version":18,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q9PSCX83","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q9PSCX83","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Wolf et al.","parsedDate":"2017-09-29","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Wolf, Julie, Ghassem R.

Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock methane emissions in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock methane emissions factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. <h3>Results</h3> Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;18.2&nbsp;Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11% greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8.4% increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36.7% increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management methane emissions for 2011 in the US increased by 71.8%. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock methane emissions, (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0.05&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.05 degree resolution. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our revised bottom-up estimates of global livestock methane emissions are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual methane emissions since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock methane emissions, while not the dominant overall source of global methane emissions, may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000s to 2010s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock methane emissions from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and bottom-up estimates of methane emissions, will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments.","websiteTitle":"Carbon Balance and Management","websiteType":"OriginalPaper","date":"2017/09/29","shortTitle":"","url":"https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:21:19Z","language":"En","rights":"2017 The Author(s)","extra":"DOI: 10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9CN9PXBB","version":6,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9CN9PXBB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9CN9PXBB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gravelle and Lachapelle","parsedDate":"2015-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gravelle, Timothy B., and Erick Lachapelle. &#x201C;Politics, Proximity and the Pipeline: Mapping Public Attitudes toward Keystone XL.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 83, no.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route. The policy implications of these findings for energy infrastructure siting controversies are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"83","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"99-108","date":"August 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.04.004","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Politics, proximity and the pipeline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515001469","accessDate":"2017-10-27T12:36:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Keystone XL","type":1},{"tag":"NIMBY","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Pipelines","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"YM4Z79DB","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Snee and Zoback","parsedDate":"2018-02-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Snee, Jens-Erik Lund, and Mark D.

In recent years, seismicity has been concentrated near Pecos, Texas; around the Dagger Draw Field, New Mexico; and near the Cogdell Field, Snyder, Texas. We have collected hundreds of measurements of stress orientation and relative magnitude to identify potentially active normal, normal/strike-slip, or strike-slip faults that might be susceptible to earthquake triggering in this region. In the Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform, the faulting regime is consistently normal/strike slip, and the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) is approximately east–west, although modest rotations of the SHmax direction are seen in some areas. Within the Delaware Basin, however, a large-magnitude clockwise rotation (∼150°) of SHmax occurs progressively from being nearly north–south in the north to east-southeast–west-northwest...","publicationTitle":"The Leading Edge","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2018-02-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1190/tle37020127.1","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"State of stress in the Permian Basin, Texas and New Mexico","url":"https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle37020127.1","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:57:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"world","libraryCatalog":"library.seg.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"8A7KDRCZ","version":9,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8A7KDRCZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8A7KDRCZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lauer et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01-04","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lauer, Nancy E., Nathaniel R.

While this practice was largely discontinued in 2011 for unconventional Marcellus OGW, it continues for conventional OGW. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental implications of the policy allowing the disposal of conventional OGW. We collected stream sediments from three discharge sites receiving treated OGW between 2014-2017 and measured 228Ra, 226Ra, and their decay products, 228Th and 210Pb, respectively. We consistently found elevated activities of 228Ra and 226Ra in stream sediments in the vicinity of the outfall (total Ra = 90-25,000 Bq/kg) compared to upstream sediments (20-80 Bq/kg). In 2015 and 2017, 228Th/228Ra activity ratios in sediments from two disposal sites were relatively low (0.2-0.7), indicating that a portion of the Ra has accumulated in the sediments in recent (<3) years, when no unconventional Marcellus OGW was reportedly discharged. 228Ra/226Ra activity ratios were also higher than what would be expected solely from disposal of low 228Ra/226Ra Marcellus OGW. Based on these variations, we concluded that recent disposal of treated conventional OGW is the source of high Ra in stream sediments at CWT facility disposal sites. Consequently, policies pertaining to the disposal of only unconventional fluids are not adequate in preventing radioactive contamination in sediments at disposal sites, and the permission to release of treated Ra-rich conventional OGW through CWT facilities should be reconsidered.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 4, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

I assume that the goal is to be reached by extensive use of solar photovoltaic and wind energy (66 percent of generating capacity), in which case the cost of energy storage will play a key role in the overall cost. I draw the tentative conclusion that a more limited use of renewables (less than 50 percent) together with increased use of nuclear power might be less costly.","publicationTitle":"Review of Environmental Economics and Policy","volume":"11","issue":"2","pages":"319-335","date":"2017/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rev Environ Econ Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/reep/rex014","ISSN":"1750-6816","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/11/2/319/3964517","accessDate":"2017-10-30T14:15:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"YARWVUDT","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YARWVUDT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YARWVUDT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rice et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-27","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rice, Andrew L., Christopher L.

Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (1984–2009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y−1 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance. A range of sensitivity tests suggests that these results are robust.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"39","pages":"10791-10796","date":"09/27/2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1522923113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10791","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:37:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 27621453","tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian inversion","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric methane","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane isotopic composition","type":1},{"tag":"methane trends","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"DHI6D54I","version":8,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DHI6D54I","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DHI6D54I","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kaplan","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kaplan, Thomas. &#x201C;Citing Health Risks, Cuomo Bans Fracking in New York State - The New York Times,&#x201D; 2014. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html?_r=0.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DHI6D54I","version":8,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Citing Health Risks, Cuomo Bans Fracking in New York State - The New York Times","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaplan"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"2014","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-ban-fracking-in-new-york-state-citing-health-risks.html?_r=0","accessDate":"2017-10-27T12:41:58Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"VEALW9C2","version":9,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VEALW9C2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VEALW9C2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kim and Oliver","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kim, Byung-Cheol, and Matthew E.

A key feature of recent methane mitigation policies is the use of periodic leak detection surveys, typically done with optical gas imaging (OGI) technologies. The most common OGI technology is an infrared camera. In this work, we experimentally develop detection probability curves for OGI-based methane leak detection under different environmental and imaging conditions. Controlled single blind leak detection tests show that the median detection limit (50% detection likelihood) for FLIR-camera based OGI technology is about 20 g CH4/h at an imaging distance of 6 m, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported estimates of 1.4 g CH4/h. Furthermore, we show that median and 90% detection likelihood limit follows a power-law relationship with imaging distance. Finally, we demonstrate that real-world marginal effectiveness of methane mitigation through periodic surveys approaches zero as leak detection sensitivity improves. For example, a median detection limit of 100 g CH4/h is sufficient to detect the maximum amount of leakage that is possible through periodic surveys. Policy makers should take note of these limits while designing equivalence metrics for next-generation leak detection technologies that can trade sensitivity for cost without affecting mitigation priorities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 19, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate sensitive sources. We reconstruct the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4-sink caused the [CH4]-plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn’t resume to cause the renewed [CH4]-rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4-emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"aad2705","date":"2016/03/10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aad2705","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad2705","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:36:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 26966190","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"API7KJCA","version":15,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/API7KJCA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/API7KJCA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Smith and Lee","parsedDate":"2017-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Smith, James L., and Thomas K.

The analysis is driven by the lognormal variability in productivity of individual wells. We find the volume of reserves to be highly inelastic with respect to price. The number of viable drilling sites is less inelastic, which may explain why reserve additions and production fell much less than drilling activity during the recent industry slump.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"67","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"121-135","date":"September 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2017.06.021","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988317302153","accessDate":"2017-10-30T14:20:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Drilling productivity","type":1},{"tag":"Lognormal distribution","type":1},{"tag":"Price elasticity","type":1},{"tag":"Shale oil","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":8,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/J86JGJNH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/J86JGJNH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Johnston et al.","parsedDate":"2016-03","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Johnston, Jill E., Emily Werder, and Daniel Sebastian. &#x201C;Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas.&#x201D; <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> 106, no. 3 (March 2016): 550&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"J86JGJNH","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Wastewater Disposal Wells, Fracking, and Environmental Injustice in Southern Texas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jill E.","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Werder"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sebastian"}],"abstractNote":"Objectives. To investigate race and poverty in areas where oil and gas wastewater disposal wells, which are used to permanently inject wastewater from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations, are permitted., Methods. With location data of oil and gas disposal wells permitted between 2007 and 2014 in the Eagle Ford area, a region of intensive fracking in southern Texas, we analyzed the racial composition of residents living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well and those farther away, adjusting for rurality and poverty, using a Poisson regression., Results. The proportion of people of color living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well was 1.3 times higher than was the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites. Adjusting for rurality, disposal wells were 2.04 times (95% confidence interval = 2.02, 2.06) as common in areas with 80% people of color or more than in majority White areas. Disposal wells are also disproportionately sited in high-poverty areas., Conclusions. Wastewater disposal wells in southern Texas are disproportionately permitted in areas with higher proportions of people of color and residents living in poverty, a pattern known as “environmental injustice.”","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"106","issue":"3","pages":"550-556","date":"2016-3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816143/","accessDate":"2018-01-31T22:01:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26794166\nPMCID: PMC4816143","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"FZ96QAIX","version":19,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FZ96QAIX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FZ96QAIX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zuckerman","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zuckerman, Gregory. <i>The Frackers: The Outrageous Inside Story of the New Billionaire Wildcatters</i>.

The average state had a tax rate of 3.6%; nationally, the average dollar of production was taxed at 4.2%. The oil-specific rate estimated for the study period is $2.4 per barrel or $5.5 per ton of carbon.

Since 2008, a rapid increase in Marcellus Shale gas production has led to a commensurate rise in associated wastewater while generation of produced water from conventional oil and gas activities has continued. In this study, we assess whether disposal practices from treatment of produced waters from both shale gas and conventional operations in Pennsylvania could result in the accumulation of associated alkali earth elements. The results from our 5 study sites indicate that there was no increase in concentrations of total Ra (Ra-226) and extractable Ba, Ca, Na, or Sr in fluvial sediments downstream of the discharge outfalls (p>0.05) of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and centralized waste treatment facilities (CWTs). However, the use of road spreading of brines from conventional oil and gas wells for deicing resulted in accumulation of Ra-226 (1.2×), and extractable Sr (3.0×), Ca (5.3×), and Na (6.2×) in soil and sediment proximal to roads (p<0.05). Although this study is an important initial assessment of the impacts of these disposal practices, more work is needed to consider the environmental consequences of produced waters management.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Coal Geology","volume":"126","issue":"","pages":"162-170","date":"June 1, 2014","series":"Environmental geology and the unconventional gas revolution","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Coal Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.coal.2013.12.001","ISSN":"0166-5162","shortTitle":"Surface disposal of produced waters in western and southwestern Pennsylvania","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516213002681","accessDate":"2018-02-12T15:17:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Conventional gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental impact","type":1},{"tag":"Produced waters disposal","type":1},{"tag":"Sediment contaminant","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"U6CWTW2C","version":15,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U6CWTW2C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U6CWTW2C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Siikamaki","parsedDate":"2016-10-31","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Revenues surge as drilling expands during booms, creating many pressures for immediate expenditure. This often sets up enormous strain during bust periods when revenues plunge as longer-term needs emerge. This paper, however, examines the small set of states that have devised unique mechanisms to prepare for future busts. It reviews two periods (1970s and 2010s) in which six oil and gas-producing states amended their state constitutions to place severance tax revenues into permanent trust funds for long-term stewardship.

A difference-in-difference fixed effects model and a spatial modeling to incorporate spatial heterogeneity and dependence among U.S. local areas that are in close geographical proximity are employed in this study. The results show that MRE industry employment grew faster during boom periods and slower during the bust period in MRE dependent counties. MRE earnings and earnings per worker grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. The findings give evidence of negative spatial indirect spillover effects between neighboring counties’ MRE sector labor markets. An analysis of the effect of shocks in the MRE sector on the non-MRE sectors shows that in MRE dependent counties non-MRE sector employment grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. Positive shocks in the MRE sector had no effect on the manufacturing sector labor market; however, negative shocks had a positively effect. Booms in the MRE sector positively impacted the construction sector, while negatively affecting the service and retail trade sectors’ labor markets in MRE dependent counties.

However, empirical evidence is limited. In this article, we consider the socioeconomic effects (particularly, related to poverty, employment, income, and wages) of unconventional oil and gas extraction using a national data set of U.S. counties. We use a novel between- and within-county random effects modeling strategy to capture both resource curse and boomtown dynamics. Further, we allow the effect of oil and gas development to be conditioned by county rurality. Broadly, our findings suggest that oil and gas development has very complex effects at the county level. Within-county growth in oil and gas production slightly improves most economic outcomes, but counties that specialize in oil and gas development tend to perform worse than other counties. We find that, in general, the effect of within-county oil and gas production is not significantly moderated by county rurality.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"n/a-n/a","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rural Sociology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12198","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"Fracking Fortunes","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ruso.12198/abstract","accessDate":"2017-12-18T15:46:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"RW2QE3SI","version":10,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RW2QE3SI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RW2QE3SI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marlowe","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Marlowe, Justin. <i>Guide to Financial Literacy, Vol. 2: Managing Your Jusridiction&#x2019;s Financial Health</i>.

The boom generated significant short-run economic gains that were quickly diluted by inward migration. In the long run though, the income gains may have turned into losses.

This article illustrates how countries dependent on point source natural resources (those extracted from a narrow geographic or economic base, such as oil and minerals) and plantation crops are predisposed to heightened economic and social divisions and weakened institutional capacity. This in turn impedes their ability to respond effectively to shocks, which previous studies have shown to be essential for sustaining rising levels of prosperity. Analysis of data on classifications of export structure, controlling for a wide array of other potential determinants of governance, shows that point source– and coffee and cocoa–exporting countries do relatively poorly across an array of governance indicators. These governance effects are not associated simply with being a natural resource exporter. Countries with natural resource exports that are diffuse—relying primarily on livestock and agricultural produce from small family farms—do not show the same strong effects—and have had more robust growth recoveries.","publicationTitle":"The World Bank Economic Review","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"141-174","date":"January 1, 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/wber/lhi010","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Varieties of Resource Experience: Natural Resource Export Structures and the Political Economy of Economic Growth","url":"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/141.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"3YPMVRW2","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3YPMVRW2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3YPMVRW2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"International Energy Agency","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

In a review of six such impact reports, Kinnaman (2011) speculates about several major issues worth scrutiny arising with analysis using input-output models. His central critique focuses on the assumptions of how industry spending is represented and how leasing and royalty dollars are spent. In this study, we use detailed county records and results from a survey to directly address these assumptions, and compare our results to the findings in an economic impact study of Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania which Kinnaman critiqued. Our results, which are only about 52% of the prior study, confirm his supposition that some ex ante studies use unrealistic assumptions which lead to gross overestimates of the impacts.","publicationTitle":"Ecological Economics","volume":"138","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"178-185","date":"August 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.03.037","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915306704","accessDate":"2017-11-14T18:27:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Input-output models","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"VV9A873D","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VV9A873D","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VV9A873D","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Herzenberg et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

This article documents evidence that the Resource Curse extends to the individual states of the US Using a variety of specifications, regression of state GSP growth on resource intensity consistently shows a negative and significant relationship. There is evidence that crowding out of the manufacturing sector may contribute to the slower growth of resource-based economies.

Our main finding is that there is an offset of about 20%, which is robust to the inclusion of control variables, the exclusion of outliers, and alternate estimation methodologies. While the impact of the offset on long-term development prospects is not clear, there is a risk of significant adjustment costs in moving to a higher level of domestic taxation once natural resources are depleted.","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Political Economy","volume":"25","issue":"4","pages":"439-446","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2009.01.003","ISSN":"0176-2680","shortTitle":"Natural resource endowments and the domestic revenue effort","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268009000068","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Domestic revenue effort"},{"tag":"Hydrocarbon revenues"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}}]
