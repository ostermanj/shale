Here we assess whether it is plausible that human activity caused these earthquakes. Analysis of both lake and groundwater variations near Azle shows that no significant stress changes were associated with the shallow water table before or during the earthquake sequence. In contrast, pore-pressure models demonstrate that a combination of brine production and wastewater injection near the fault generated subsurface pressures sufficient to induce earthquakes on near-critically stressed faults. On the basis of modelling results and the absence of historical earthquakes near Azle, brine production combined with wastewater disposal represent the most likely cause of recent seismicity near Azle. For assessing the earthquake cause, our research underscores the necessity of monitoring subsurface wastewater formation pressures and monitoring earthquakes having magnitudes of ∼M2 and greater. Currently, monitoring at these levels is not standard across Texas or the United States.","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"6728","date":"2015-04-21","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms7728","ISSN":"2041-1723","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7728","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:22:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2015 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK","FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3W847UYM"},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T16:22:33Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:58:13Z"}},{"key":"6RMH877P","version":3676,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RMH877P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RMH877P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2015-05-19","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

Space-based observations have identified the Four Corners region in the Southwest United States as an area of large CH4 enhancements. We conducted an airborne campaign in Four Corners during April 2015 with the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (near-infrared) and Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (thermal infrared) imaging spectrometers to better understand the source of methane by measuring methane plumes at 1- to 3-m spatial resolution. Our analysis detected more than 250 individual methane plumes from fossil fuel harvesting, processing, and distributing infrastructures, spanning an emission range from the detection limit ∼∼<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math> 2 kg/h to 5 kg/h through ∼∼<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math> 5,000 kg/h. Observed sources include gas processing facilities, storage tanks, pipeline leaks, and well pads, as well as a coal mine venting shaft. Overall, plume enhancements and inferred fluxes follow a lognormal distribution, with the top 10% emitters contributing 49 to 66% to the inferred total point source flux of 0.23 Tg/y to 0.39 Tg/y. With the observed confirmation of a lognormal emission distribution, this airborne observing strategy and its ability to locate previously unknown point sources in real time provides an efficient and effective method to identify and mitigate major emissions contributors over a wide geographic area. With improved instrumentation, this capability scales to spaceborne applications [Thompson DR, et al. (2016) Geophys Res Lett 43(12):6571–6578]. Further illustration of this potential is demonstrated with two detected, confirmed, and repaired pipeline leaks during the campaign.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"201605617","date":"2016/08/11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1605617113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1605617113","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:48:04Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Both unconventional oil and natural gas wells typically feature\nhigh initial rates of production that decline steeply and quickly, and eventually stabilize at relatively low levels.\nThe respective production profiles for unconventional oil and natural gas wells are consistent enough across shale\nplays to offer a sound basis for comparing how states tax policies raise revenue from these new resources.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Bozeman, MT","institution":"Headwaters Economics","date":"2013","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://okpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/State_tax_comparison_study-full-2.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:22Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:55:53Z"}},{"key":"JSWQJVIE","version":3671,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/JSWQJVIE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/JSWQJVIE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fershee","parsedDate":"2012-11-14","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fershee, Joshua P. &#x201C;The Oil and Gas Evolution: Learning from the Hydraulic Fracturing Experiences in North Dakota and West Virginia,&#x201D; November 14, 2012. https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2175798.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"JSWQJVIE","version":3671,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Oil and Gas Evolution: Learning from the Hydraulic Fracturing Experiences in North Dakota and West Virginia","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua P.","lastName":"Fershee"}],"abstractNote":"This Article discusses major differences and similarities in U.S. oil and gas extraction via hydraulic fracturing through a comparison of the experiences in North Dakota and West Virginia.  Although there are other parts of the country experiencing growth in oil and gas extraction, Pennsylvania and Texas as but two examples, North Dakota and West Virginia are particularly apt for comparison.  Both states have relatively small populations, meaning that the impact of large-scale energy extraction in each state is likely to have a large impact on the state, economically, environmentally, and socially.  This paper focuses on three main areas of comparison. First, the Article discusses the impact of the oil industry in North Dakota and the gas industry in West Virginia, including portions of the the financial, environmental, and social impacts of the hydraulic fracturing boom.  Next, the article discusses briefly the legislative and regulatory landscape of both states and how each state’s approach to enforcement and planning can and is likely to impact development in the state. Finally, the Article concludes that the North Dakota and West Virginia experiences can and should inform state and federal policy with regard to hydraulic fracturing and energy policy generally, and provides some suggestions designed to maximize the value of the lessons already learned.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012/11/14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Oil and Gas Evolution","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2175798","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:28:28Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"energy law","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"gas","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"oil","type":1},{"tag":"regulation","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:28:28Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:53:01Z"}},{"key":"9U7VIGIN","version":3668,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9U7VIGIN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9U7VIGIN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rabe and Hampton","parsedDate":"2016-10-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rabe, Barry G., and Rachel L.

Revenues surge as drilling expands during booms, creating many pressures for immediate expenditure. This often sets up enormous strain during bust periods when revenues plunge as longer-term needs emerge. This paper, however, examines the small set of states that have devised unique mechanisms to prepare for future busts. It reviews two periods (1970s and 2010s) in which six oil and gas-producing states amended their state constitutions to place severance tax revenues into permanent trust funds for long-term stewardship. It examines the key political factors that prompted the formation of these funds while also considering their resilience and performance to date.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"20","issue":"","pages":"117-127","date":"October 1, 2016","series":"Risks, the Social Sciences, and Unconventional Hydrocarbons","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.06.011","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Trusting in the future","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616301402","accessDate":"2018-08-08T23:52:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Severance taxes","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Trust funds","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T23:52:05Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:52:05Z"}},{"key":"DLCP2KA4","version":3667,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DLCP2KA4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DLCP2KA4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lippert","parsedDate":"2008","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lippert, Tammy. &#x201C;The Impact of Severance Taxes on the Arkansas Natural Gas Market,&#x201D; 2008, 11. http://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1124&amp;context=inquiry.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DLCP2KA4","version":3667,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Impact of Severance Taxes on the Arkansas Natural Gas Market","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tammy","lastName":"Lippert"}],"abstractNote":"The recent development of the Fayetteville Shale Play, an unconventional natural gas reservoir in Central and Eastern Arkansas, has created considerable opportunities for the state and its citizens as the industry has made substantial investment in the region. These developments have resulted in thousands of new jobs for Arkansans, billions ofdollars in direct and indirect output, and millions in state and local tax revenues. One of the most visible issues in recent state news has been the controversy surrounding the severance tax levied by the state government on the extraction of natural gas. The question at hand has been whether or not to increase Arkansas's rate. The state has had the lowest severance tat incidence in the nation causing many to speak out for a raise in the tat rate to something comparable to surrounding states in the region. These demands caught the attention ofArkansas Governor Beebe who worked with natural gas companies to find a reasonable severance tax package including some discounts for shale play wells. The legislature shortly thereafter apprm·ed this increase to be enacted January 1, 2009. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the states reaction to these recent events and offer any additional recommendations that may enhance this set of decisions. A comparison of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas was conducted on multiple levels of economic conditions to evaluate the overall tat structure within each state. Outside research was also considered informing these conclusions. After completing an extensive cross-state comparison and incorporating econometric research, it was determined that the Arkansas state legislature was justified in increasing the severance tar rate. However, the rationale for tat increases- specifically the reasoning that other states have higher severance tat rates- is somewhatflawed based on consideration of economic conditions, nawral gas production numbers, and overall tar structures. A stronger rationale lies in additional research that suggests that an increase in liabilities for severance uues yields minor changes in investment and drilling activity and potentially positive economic rewards.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"11","date":"2008","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1124&context=inquiry","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T19:55:33Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:50:16Z"}},{"key":"7KUCMVLZ","version":3666,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7KUCMVLZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7KUCMVLZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Morris","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Morris, Adele. &#x201C;The Challenge of State Reliance on Revenue from Fossil Fuel Production.&#x201D; Brooking Institution, Climate and Energy Economics Discussion Paper, August 9, 2016, 2016. https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/state-fiscal-implications-of-fossil-fuel-production-0809216-morris.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7KUCMVLZ","version":3666,"itemType":"report","title":"The Challenge of State Reliance on Revenue from Fossil Fuel Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adele","lastName":"Morris"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Brooking Institution, Climate and Energy Economics Discussion Paper, August 9, 2016","institution":"","date":"2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"The Challenge of State Reliance on Revenue from Fossil Fuel Production","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/state-fiscal-implications-of-fossil-fuel-production-0809216-morris.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:49:10Z"}},{"key":"2UDY7DSM","version":3665,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2UDY7DSM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2UDY7DSM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rabe and Hampton","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rabe, Barry G, and Rachel L Hampton. &#x201C;Taxing Fracking: The Politics of State Severance Taxes in the Shale Era.&#x201D; <i>Review of Policy Research</i> 32, no. 4 (2015): 389&#x2013;412. https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/112282.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"2UDY7DSM","version":3665,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Taxing fracking: The politics of state severance taxes in the shale era","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Barry G","lastName":"Rabe"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rachel L","lastName":"Hampton"}],"abstractNote":"States producing gas and oil have long levied severance taxes at the point of extraction, commonly\nplacing most revenues into general funds.

We use adjustment cost and discount rate to calibrate the model against historical production data, and use the calibrated model to simulate the impact of tax policy on production rate. We construct field-specific cost functions from average cost data and an estimated inverse production function, which incorporates engineering aspects of oil production into our economic modeling. Producers appear to have approximated dynamic optimality. Consistent with prior research, we find that changing the tax rate alone does not change the economically optimal oil production path, except for marginal fields that may cease production. Contrary to prior research, we find that the structure of tax policy can be designed to affect the economically optimal production path, but at a cost in net social benefit.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"41","issue":"","pages":"759-774","date":"February 1, 2012","series":"Modeling Transport (Energy) Demand and Policies","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.043","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Tax policy can change the production path","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009207","accessDate":"2018-08-08T23:44:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Alaska","type":1},{"tag":"Oil production","type":1},{"tag":"Taxation","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T23:44:19Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:44:23Z"}},{"key":"SV88XMRF","version":3655,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SV88XMRF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SV88XMRF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kim and Oliver","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kim, Byung-Cheol, and Matthew E.

For instance, Alaska has increased the severance tax on the value of its oil production and attempted to stimulate future production by allowing a credit against this tax for expenditures on capital items, including drilling rigs, infrastructure, exploration, and facility expansion (Alaska Department of Revenue 2008). In late 2008, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed levying a 9.9 percent production tax on the value of most onshore oil production to help close a projected $24 billion budget deficit, but he subsequently reversed his position (Casselman 2009; Skelton 2009). The Pennsylvania legislature is considering a proposal to levy a 5 percent tax on the value of natural gas produced from the giant Marcellus shale deposit, but the bill is opposed by industry leaders who contend that it would result in 30 percent less drilling as well as revenue reductions to state and local governments totaling $880 million over the next decade (George 2009). These measures, both enacted and proposed, raise a number of long-standing and important questions about the effects of state energy taxes that go well beyond their potential to provide a solid revenue base to support public services.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 2010","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241854001_State_tax_policy_and_oil_production_The_role_of_the_severance_tax_and_credits_for_drilling_expenses","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:59Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:42:18Z"}},{"key":"IXIDLFNI","version":3650,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IXIDLFNI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IXIDLFNI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cassarah Brown","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cassarah Brown. &#x201C;State Revenues and the Natural Gas Boom: An Assessment of State Oil and Gas Production Taxes.&#x201D; Accessed July 31, 2018. http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-revenues-and-the-natural-gas-boom.aspx.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IXIDLFNI","version":3650,"itemType":"report","title":"State Revenues and the Natural Gas Boom: An Assessment of State Oil and Gas Production Taxes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Cassarah Brown"}],"abstractNote":"As technological developments increase access to natural gas reserves across the country, states are exploring ways to benefit from these newly accessible resources and to ensure that communities are reimbursed for the impact that natural gas development may have on infrastructure.

To produce at commercial rates, shale gas wells are drilled horizontally and fractured to release their gas, and since 1994, a severance tax exemption on horizontal wells has been in effect, offering an incentive to investors to promote industry activity. In 2011, the Haynesville shale contributed 60% to the state’s gas production, and the impact of the horizontal severance tax exemption on revenue collection has been significant. The purpose of this paper is to model the horizontal well severance tax exemption for Haynesville shale gas wells to quantify its impact and the manner in which severance tax revenues are split between the operator and government. We develop an analytic framework to value the tax exemption under prevailing production, cost, and price scenarios. We estimate that the 2011 inventory of Haynesville wells will generate between $1.2 to $1.5 billion in severance tax revenue throughout their lifetime with at least 64% accruing to the private sector.

KELSEY"}],"abstractNote":"Development of Marcellus shale natural gas in Pennsylvania has brought many changes to parts of the\nCommonwealth. Because of the rather recent nature of the drilling activity, the extent of its effects on local\neconomies and state tax collections has not been clearly understood. Marcellus-related activity can affect these through several means. Leasing and royalty income paid to mineral right owners increases household income, and since it is taxable under the state’s personal income tax, will affect state income tax collections. Increases in local employment or earnings due to Marcellus-related work can likewise affect state income tax collections. If mineral right owners and those employed due to Marcellus development spend more money locally, state sales tax\ncollections can increase. If development of the Marcellus Shale affects local real estate markets, it may similarly\naffect realty transfer tax collections.\nIt still is early in the development of Marcellus Shale, so much cannot be known about its full long run economic\nimplications. Yet state tax collection information gathered by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue can provide some insight into the short run economic and state tax implications of gas development in the Commonwealth. This Fact Sheet provides basic analysis of state tax information between the years of 2007-2011 as reported in the Department of Revenue’s ‘Pennsylvania Tax Compendium.’ The Fact Sheet updates similar analysis we conducted last year using 2010 data (Costanzo and Kelsey, 2011), and provides a more current\nperspective on Marcellus shale activity and state taxes. The data continue to show distinct differences between\ncounties with Marcellus Shale gas drilling and those without.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Marcellus-and-State-Tax-Implications.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T23:28:16Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:29:32Z"}},{"key":"4QDVLYWQ","version":3630,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4QDVLYWQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4QDVLYWQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Farren et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Farren, Michael, Amanda L Weinstein, and Mark D Partridge. &#x201C;Making Shale Development Work for Ohio,&#x201D; n.d., 26.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4QDVLYWQ","version":3630,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Making Shale Development Work for Ohio","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Farren"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Amanda L","lastName":"Weinstein"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mark D","lastName":"Partridge"}],"abstractNote":"There are several main points that Ohio policymakers need to remember if Ohio is to be a future example of how to turn the resource curse into a blessing:\n1.

Cross-state comparisons are problematic because states often selectively apply their rates. Using state-level data on oil and gas production and the revenue generated by it, we calculate an effective average tax rate on production. For the 2004-2013 period, we find much variation in effective rates across states, with three states having a rate of 0.1 percent or less and three states having a rate of more than 7.0 percent. The typical state had a 3.6 percent tax rate while the typical dollar of production was taxed at a higher rate, at 4.4 percent. The average state rate increased by about 20 percent from the 2004-2008 period to the 2009-2013 period while taxation of the typical dollar of production saw a smaller increase. On average state tax policy is neutral towards oil versus gas, taxing both at a similar rate.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Retrieved from SSRN","institution":"","date":"2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"How Much Do US State Governments Really Tax Oil and Gas Extraction?","url":"http://www.gspia.pitt.edu/Portals/0/General_PDF/Effective_Tax_Rates_USAEE.pdf?ver=2015-10-27-130503-040","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T23:21:15Z"}},{"key":"S75ZR7KQ","version":3666,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/S75ZR7KQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/S75ZR7KQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"LOREN C.

The analysis centered around three basic questions: (1) How much net revenue would a severance tax raise for state and local governments in California? (2) Who would pay the tax? (3) How would the tax affect the production of oil within California? Part I provides some basic background information on severance taxation in general and on oil production in California. It also explains the methodological approach to tax analysis. Part 2 presents the results of the formal analysis. In addition to the three basic questions it also answers the questions: (1) How much net tax burden will fall within California and how much can be exported?

Finally, the memo also provides estimates of severance taxes paid in each county in Colorado derived from the Legislative Council Staff oil and gas severance tax forecast model.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://leg.colorado.gov/publications/effective-severance-tax-rates-oil-and-gas","accessDate":"2018-08-08T22:40:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T22:40:19Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T22:42:30Z"}},{"key":"UZVFZXL5","version":3606,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UZVFZXL5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UZVFZXL5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kunce","parsedDate":"2003-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kunce, Mitch. &#x201C;Effectiveness of Severance Tax Incentives in the U.S. Oil Industry.&#x201D; <i>International Tax and Public Finance</i> 10, no. 5 (September 1, 2003): 565&#x2013;87. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026122323810.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"UZVFZXL5","version":3606,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effectiveness of Severance Tax Incentives in the U.S. Oil Industry","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mitch","lastName":"Kunce"}],"abstractNote":"This paper develops a dynamic empirical framework that can be used to test the effectiveness of state-level severance tax incentives in the U.S. oil industry. The framework embeds U.S. state-level panel data estimates into Pindyck's (1978) widely received theoretical model of exhaustible resource supply and can be applied to any of 20 states that produce significant quantities of oil. The model allows for interactions between taxes levied by different levels of government and for the first time addresses potential interstate differences in exploration costs, extraction costs, and reserve additions. In general, results show that severance tax incentives (in the form of tax rate reductions) substantially reduce state tax revenue collected, but yield moderate to little change in oil drilling and production activity. This outcome suggests that states should be wary of arguments asserting that large swings in oil field activity can be obtained from changes in severance tax rates.","publicationTitle":"International Tax and Public Finance","volume":"10","issue":"5","pages":"565-587","date":"2003/09/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Tax and Public Finance","language":"en","DOI":"10.1023/A:1026122323810","ISSN":"0927-5940, 1573-6970","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026122323810","accessDate":"2018-08-08T22:41:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["APRI3VMZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T22:41:06Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T22:41:06Z"}},{"key":"3D678J9X","version":3601,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3D678J9X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3D678J9X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barclay R.

Consequently, several polls have been conducted over time to gauge public attitude towards offshore drilling. Nevertheless, the economic literature on this issue is sparse. This paper contributes to the literature and analyzes support for offshore drilling based on demographic, economic, social, belief, and shock (e.g. spill) factors. The data is taken from ten nationwide surveys conducted before, during and after the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill and analyzed within the framework of discrete choice model. The results from an ordinal probit model demonstrate that age, annual household income, affiliation to Republican Party, and residence in oil-rich states positively affect the probability of strong support and reduce the probability of strong opposition for offshore drilling. In contrast, the female gender, higher education, association to Democratic Party, and environmental concern affect opinion in opposite direction. Marginal effects show that belief about environmental consequences of drilling has the highest impact on opinion. Binary probit model also yields a similar result and suggests that BP oil disaster resulted in a transient decrease in support for offshore drilling.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"91","issue":"","pages":"341-351","date":"April 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.023","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"To drill or not to drill?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515302019","accessDate":"2018-08-08T22:24:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"BP oil spill","type":1},{"tag":"Binary probit","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental belief","type":1},{"tag":"Offshore drilling","type":1},{"tag":"Ordinal probit","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T22:24:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T22:24:55Z"}},{"key":"7NUPZHVM","version":3592,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7NUPZHVM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7NUPZHVM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Boudet et al.","parsedDate":"2016-07-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Boudet, Hilary, Dylan Bugden, Chad Zanocco, and Edward Maibach. &#x201C;The Effect of Industry Activities on Public Support for &#x2018;Fracking.&#x2019;&#x201D; <i>Environmental Politics</i> 25, no. 4 (July 3, 2016): 593&#x2013;612. https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2016.1153771.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7NUPZHVM","version":3592,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The effect of industry activities on public support for ‘fracking’","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Boudet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dylan","lastName":"Bugden"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Zanocco"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Maibach"}],"abstractNote":"Research suggests that previous, current, and prospective extractive industry activities influence perceptions of new development.

Using the 2012 US Presidential Elections as a backdrop, the analysis highlights the cooption of the concepts “security,” “independence,” and “sustainability” in energy debates by different and often opposing interest groups. The article’s first section traces the malleability of energy terminology to the vagueness of the term “energy” itself and notes how qualifying words like security, independence, and sustainability have been selectively exploited to introduce further ambiguity to an already fungible concept. The second section notes that while energy is a critical and complex factor of macroeconomic production, its main public visibility comes via a few partially representative numbers, like gasoline prices. This mismatch of broad social importance and piecemeal public understanding enables organized interests to leverage vague terminology in support of particular policy ideas. The third section examines three policymaking tools (1) taxation, (2) regulation, and (3) technology promotion and compares these administrative instruments. Ultimately, the article concludes that loosely defined terminology inhibits energy policy discussion and stifles meaningful public debate over and action on energy issues.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"52","issue":"","pages":"779-788","date":"January 1, 2013","series":"Special Section: Transition Pathways to a Low Carbon Economy","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.040","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Security, independence, and sustainability","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009214","accessDate":"2018-08-08T22:00:07Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"Interest groups","type":1},{"tag":"Language","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T22:00:07Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T22:00:07Z"}},{"key":"L7MS3LFG","version":3582,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/L7MS3LFG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/L7MS3LFG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brasier et al.","parsedDate":"2013-06-01","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brasier, Kathryn J., Diane K.

At the core of these debates are differing perceptions of the level and types of risks involved with the extraction activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, truck traffic, air emissions, and population growth. Risks described include the potential for human and environmental health implications, as well as community change and economic gain. This article explores the nature of perceived risks associated with Marcellus Shale development by using data from a household survey (N = 1,917) conducted in 2009–10 in Pennsylvania and New York counties located in the core areas of the Marcellus Shale region. The article describes a quantitative measure of risk perceptions. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that trust in institutions responsible for managing the risks associated with development and attitudes related to relationships between people and nature are associated strongly with perceptions of risk. Other associated variables include reported knowledge of environmental, social, and economic impacts, mineral rights ownership, demographic characteristics (gender, income), and state of residence.

We argue that these disparities may be a result of the dramatic shift in the geography of energy production in the US. The rise of fracking has redistributed environmental injustices beyond traditional national sacrifice zones, such as Appalachia, and towards regions that in many cases are wealthier than Appalachia and have not recently borne the brunt of energy production, causing profound social, cultural, and economic shocks. Reviewing the physical and social science literature together suggests that we reconsider the fracking research agenda. Studies of the physical impacts of hydraulic fracturing should be expanded to address communities' concerns about habitat fragmentation and the impacts of the myriad truck trips required to service fracking wells, neither of which currently are given much attention. Social science research on fracking could benefit from an increase in comparative work, assessing the relative economic and social impacts in regions where energy production is ramping up in relation to regions where it is declining.","publicationTitle":"Geography Compass","volume":"8","issue":"10","pages":"739-754","date":"2014-10-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/gec3.12162","ISSN":"1749-8198","shortTitle":"Hydraulic Fracturing","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gec3.12162","accessDate":"2018-08-08T21:55:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2014 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T21:55:39Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T21:55:39Z"}},{"key":"5NY6D97V","version":3574,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5NY6D97V","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5NY6D97V","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"TIMOTHY B.

In addition to offering protections to the environment\nand wildlife, they provide numerous opportunities for individuals to participate in healthy activities across\nskill levels and age. The programs and services offered in local, provincial–state, and national parks allow\nfor citizens from diverse population groups to pursue sport, recreation, and leisure (Godbey, Caldwell,\nFloyd, & Payne, 2005). The preservation and continued accessibility of these spaces—and the natural\nenvironments of which they are a part—are therefore paramount to fostering healthy lifestyles and\ncommunities.\nParks and recreation spaces are significant to a number of stakeholders; while less apparent than park\nvisitors and community members, energy companies are becoming increasingly active users because of\nthe valuable pockets of natural gas that underlie many public spaces. Following the innovation of\nhydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to effectively collect natural gas, there has been growing interest in\nplacing exploration and extraction wells in or adjacent to a number of public park and forest systems\nacross Europe and North America (e.g., Cowell, 2013; Rowland & Drabold, 2014). Opponents of fracking\nleases on public land have argued that in addition to air contaminants and polluted greywater on\nrecreational fields, park acreage will be lost to fracking operations and park attendance will decrease\n(e.g., Gardner, 2014). For administrators and policymakers, these outcomes would be especially troubling\ngiven the role that public green spaces are expected to play in reversing the decline in youth sport\nparticipation (The Aspen Institute, 2015) and creating new generations of physically active individuals and\ncommunities.\nThere is a growing body of literature focused on environmental issues in park management, but this\nstudy represents one of the first investigations specifically looking at fracking operations related to park\nusage and participation. The purposes of this study are to explore the parkland–fracking link and to\nconsider the extent—if any—to which fracking operations taking place in or around designated public\nparks affect expectations of continued visitation and participation. In other words, if fracking operations\nwere to take place on or near public parkland, how would visitation be affected—or, what do currently\nactive park users predict will happen?","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"AUGUST 2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://plaza.ufl.edu/tkellison/_/Home_files/Fracking-Parkland_Report.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T21:45:13Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T21:47:56Z"}},{"key":"UYUYYUJK","version":3567,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UYUYYUJK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UYUYYUJK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bishop","parsedDate":"2014-03-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bishop, Bradford H. &#x201C;Focusing Events and Public Opinion: Evidence from the &lt;Emphasis Type=\"Italic\"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/Emphasis&gt; Disaster.&#x201D; <i>Political Behavior</i> 36, no. 1 (March 1, 2014): 1&#x2013;22. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-013-9223-7.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"UYUYYUJK","version":3567,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Focusing Events and Public Opinion: Evidence from the <Emphasis Type=\"Italic\">Deepwater Horizon</Emphasis> Disaster","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bradford H.","lastName":"Bishop"}],"abstractNote":"Scholarly research has found a weak and inconsistent role for self-interest in public opinion, and mixed evidence for a relationship between local pollution risks and support for environmental protection. In this study, I argue that focusing events can induce self-interested responses from people living in communities whose economies are implicated by the event. I leverage a unique 12-wave panel survey administered between 2008 and 2010 to analyze public opinion toward offshore oil drilling before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. I find that residence in counties highly dependent upon the offshore drilling industry was predictive of pro-drilling attitudes following the spill, though not prior to the spill. In addition, there is no significant evidence that residence in a county afflicted by the spill influenced opinion. This study concludes that local support for drilling often arises only after focusing events make the issue salient.","publicationTitle":"Political Behavior","volume":"36","issue":"1","pages":"1-22","date":"2014/03/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Polit Behav","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s11109-013-9223-7","ISSN":"0190-9320, 1573-6687","shortTitle":"Focusing Events and Public Opinion","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-013-9223-7","accessDate":"2018-08-08T21:44:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T21:44:09Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T21:44:09Z"}},{"key":"EFEAVD5N","version":3565,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EFEAVD5N","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EFEAVD5N","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gene L.

Further, contributions made to self-reported\nknowledge of hydraulic fracturing by eight different sources and the amount of trust in each of\nthe same sources to deliver unbiased, factual knowledge about the topic were investigated.\nBuilding upon previous research on the public’s perception of produced water by Theodori and\nhis colleagues (Theodori et al. 2009, 2011), the level of agreement that treated wastewater from\nhydraulic fracturing operations could safely be used for selected purposes was assessed. Lastly,\nthe associations between level of familiarity with frac flowback wastewater treatment technology\nand the proposed potential uses of treated wastewater were evaluated using bivariate and\nmultivariate logistic regression techniques. Differences in the information reported by\nrespondents living in high well-density counties (20 or more wells per 100 square miles) and\ntheir counterparts living in low well-density counties (fewer than 20 wells per 100 square miles)\nwere also examined. The results contained in this report should prove beneficial to members of\nthe general public, community leaders, oil and gas industry representatives, government and\nregulatory agency personnel, environmental and non-governmental organization\nrepresentatives, and other interested stakeholders. Possible implications and recommendations\nof the findings are advanced.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.shsu.edu/dotAsset/2901f87d-ff2d-4e43-9110-2a33db928dba.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T21:33:52Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T21:35:31Z"}},{"key":"DU4J8W55","version":3560,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DU4J8W55","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DU4J8W55","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Muehlenbachs et al.","parsedDate":"2015-12","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Muehlenbachs, Lucija, Elisheba Spillr, and Christopher Timmins. &#x201C;The Housing Market Impacts of Shale Gas Development,&#x201D; December 2015, 52. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140079.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DU4J8W55","version":3560,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Housing Market Impacts of Shale Gas Development","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lucija","lastName":"Muehlenbachs"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elisheba","lastName":"Spillr"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Timmins"}],"abstractNote":"Using data from New York and Pennsylvania and an array of empirical techniques to control for confounding factors, we recover hedonic estimates of property value impacts from shale gas development that vary with geographic scale and water source.

CSCE conducted interviews with over 70 stakeholders in six counties\n(Bradford, Greene, Lycoming, Sullivan, Washington and Westmoreland) including local elected officials,\ncounty and municipal planners, housing authority officials, social service agency representatives,\nlandlords, developers, realtors, gas company representatives and new residents on four broad issues: 1)\nrental housing, 2) owner-occupied housing, 3) housing affordability and availability, and 4) the capacity\nof the development community to meet demand for housing.\nSeveral broad themes emerged from the interviews. First, the severity of the housing problem\nattributable to Marcellus Shale development depends on the nature and scale of the growth of the\nnatural gas industry in a given county or community and on the existing pre-Marcellus capacity of that\ncounty or community to absorb the increased demand for housing. Generally, communities experiencing\nthe highest Marcellus activity relative to their size are experiencing the most difficult housing problems.\nIn addition, counties where gas producers and service companies are establishing regional headquarters\nsee more and longer term housing impacts than communities where there is only drilling and pipeline\nactivity.\nCounties that have previously experienced population growth due to other industries in the area or an\ninflux or commuters from neighboring larger cities have existing development capacity. In these areas\nthere are local and regional builders who are familiar with the areas housing needs and are experienced\nin working with the area’s zoning regulations and county and city officials. These builders are ready to\nrespond to any increase in housing needs.\nSecond, the effects of increased housing demand are broad-based, but the negative impacts are felt\nheaviest by those living at the economic margins. While rents and home prices are increasing at nearly\nall price points, the impacts of the housing shortage are falling heaviest on those whose housing\nsituation was most at risk prior to the Marcellus industry growth, namely the non-working poor, seniors,\nthe disabled and, newly, the working poor. Never having extensive housing options, these groups are\nfaced with few choices in most affected communities, often limited to substandard housing or “couch\nsurfing” homelessness.\nAdditionally, the natural gas industry has a wide variety of housing needs with varying time frames. Two\nwaves of gas industry employment correspond to the evolving housing needs of industry employees. For\nthe first transitory wave of gas workers, housing needs are being met with hotels, gas-company\nsponsored temporary residential facilities (often called man camps), campgrounds and a community’s\nrental housing stock.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"September 31, 2011","pages":"67","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://housingalliancepa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Lycoming-PHFA-Marcellus_report.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T00:11:03Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T17:13:34Z"}},{"key":"G2AMXW36","version":3557,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/G2AMXW36","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/G2AMXW36","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jonathan Williamson and Bonita Kolb","parsedDate":"2015-11-10","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jonathan Williamson, and Bonita Kolb. &#x201C;Marcellus Natural Gas Development&#x2019;s Effect on Housing in Pennsylvania: 2015 Update,&#x201D; November 10, 2015. https://www.lycoming.edu/political-science/pdfs/marcellus-housing-report-2015.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"G2AMXW36","version":3557,"itemType":"report","title":"Marcellus Natural Gas Development’s Effect on Housing in Pennsylvania: 2015 Update","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Jonathan Williamson"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Bonita Kolb"}],"abstractNote":"In 2011 the Center for the Study of Community and the Economy (CSCE) at Lycoming College was\ncommissioned by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA) to research the effects that the\nMarcellus Shale natural gas industry had on housing across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 2015\nPHFA commissioned CSCE to revisit the issue. The new research consisted of over 50 interviews of local\nelected officials, county and municipal planners, housing authority officials, social service agency\nrepresentatives, developers, realtors, and gas company representatives on the following issues: 1) rental\nhousing affordability and availability, 2) owner-occupied housing, and 3) related development activity.\nThe interviews were conducted in Bradford, Lycoming, Greene, Susquehanna, Washington, and\nWestmoreland Counties. In addition secondary housing data from the Census and the U.S. Department\nof Housing and Urban Development, amongst others was analyzed. Finally, information was gathered on\nthe use of local Act 13 Impact Fee funds on housing.\nThe most critical finding of the prior 2011 study was the interconnectedness of the rental housing\nmarket. The ramp up of Marcellus development caused a shortage of rental housing units, with low\nincome individuals and families being most affected. As housing became in short supply, prices rose. The\nbetter quality apartments were taken by gas employees at high rents. Everyone else had to settle for\nliving in lower quality apartments with higher rents, causing a housing crisis that forced those in the\nlowest quality housing out of the rental market into couch surfing or other forms of homelessness.\nRevisiting the issue in 2015 there is a continued lack of availability in affordable rentals, though the\nsituation is no longer in crisis, partly because of a lessening of drilling activity and partly because of an\nability to adapt. While rents had doubled or tripled during the Marcellus build up they have fallen by a\nmuch smaller percentage. Although rents have leveled off in all communities and even declined\nsomewhat in many areas, they are not back to pre-Marcellus levels. Low-income renters who do not\nhave access to subsidized housing are often still forced to rent overpriced units. Many of these units\nhave declined in quality due to renting to gas workers so that they are not acceptable to be included in\nthe HUD housing voucher program. One area, senior housing, did see additional development due to tax\nincentives and the packaging of government funding.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"November 10, 2015","pages":"43","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.lycoming.edu/political-science/pdfs/marcellus-housing-report-2015.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T00:10:13Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T17:13:31Z"}},{"key":"TMJ9FCNZ","version":3549,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TMJ9FCNZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TMJ9FCNZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Colborn et al.","parsedDate":"2011-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Colborn, Theo, Carol Kwiatkowski, Kim Schultz, and Mary Bachran. &#x201C;Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective.&#x201D; <i>Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal</i> 17, no. 5 (September 1, 2011): 1039&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"TMJ9FCNZ","version":3549,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Colborn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carol","lastName":"Kwiatkowski"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Schultz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Bachran"}],"abstractNote":"The technology to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and amounts of toxic chemicals. A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas operations was compiled. Literature searches were conducted to determine potential health effects of the 353 chemicals identified by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers. More than 75% of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Approximately 40–50% could affect the brain/nervous system, immune and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys; 37% could affect the endocrine system; and 25% could cause cancer and mutations. These results indicate that many chemicals used during the fracturing and drilling stages of gas operations may have long-term health effects that are not immediately expressed. In addition, an example was provided of waste evaporation pit residuals that contained numerous chemicals on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) lists of hazardous substances. The discussion highlights the difficulty of developing effective water quality monitoring programs. To protect public health we recommend full disclosure of the contents of all products, extensive air and water monitoring, coordinated environmental/human health studies, and regulation of fracturing under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act.","publicationTitle":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal","volume":"17","issue":"5","pages":"1039-1056","date":"September 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","ISSN":"1080-7039","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","accessDate":"2018-08-08T16:48:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"drilling","type":1},{"tag":"health","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"ozone","type":1},{"tag":"pollution","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T16:48:54Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T16:48:54Z"}},{"key":"IB88A2U7","version":3545,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IB88A2U7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IB88A2U7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brunnschweiler and Bulte","parsedDate":"2008-05-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brunnschweiler, Christa N., and Erwin H.

Explanations for this “curse of resources” focus on institutional and market failures caused by resource abundance. With a simple two sector model exhaustible resource model, we demonstrate that the correlation between growth and natural resource abundance can be negative in the absence of market and institutional failures. Since there is no way to distinguish between efficient and inefficient equilibria on the basis of the negative correlation between growth and resource abundance, finding that correlation is not sufficient to conclude resources are a curse, nor is it necessary to find a positive correlation between growth and resources to overturn the resource curse interpretation. We show whether resources are a curse or a blessing for an economy can only be determined by an investigation of the correlation between resource abundance and income levels. Using panel data for U.S. states for the period 1970–2001, we show that resource abundance is negatively correlated with growth rates but positively correlated with income levels.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"36","issue":"1","pages":"1-13","date":"March 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Resources Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2010.08.004","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420710000450","accessDate":"2018-08-08T15:57:07Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Exhaustible resources","type":1},{"tag":"Resource curse","type":1}],"collections":["4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T15:57:07Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T15:57:07Z"}},{"key":"2D2Q3EVA","version":3525,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2D2Q3EVA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2D2Q3EVA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Allan M Zarembski","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Allan M Zarembski. &#x201C;Assessment of Crude by Rail (CBR) Safety Issues in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,&#x201D; n.d. http://www.cleanwateraction.org/files/publications/pa/Assessment-of-Crude-by-Rail-CBR-Safety-Issues-in-Commonwealth-of-Pennsylvania%20Report.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"2D2Q3EVA","version":3525,"itemType":"report","title":"Assessment of Crude by Rail (CBR) Safety Issues in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Allan M Zarembski"}],"abstractNote":"As the volume of Crude By Rail (CBR) shipments have increased over the past several years, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has become increasingly concerned about the risks of a CBR incident occurring on a rail line that goes through populated areas within the state.

At the same time, regulators and environmental groups are concerned about potential environmental damage associated with hydraulic fracturing. However, small firms are protected from the full extent of their damages, while large firms must internalize a greater portion of their social costs. This paper examines the effect of firm size and liability on environmental safety in the context of hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale across three dimensions of size. Impacts of firm size on safety are found across legal, regulatory, and brand dimensions of size with the largest effects being driven by changes in regulatory liability. These safety gains are sizable as violation rates would be approximately twice as high if firms at remained at 2008 sizes.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"53","issue":"","pages":"101-113","date":"August 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Resource and Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.reseneeco.2018.02.006","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765517301537","accessDate":"2018-08-08T14:15:52Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental safety","type":1},{"tag":"Firm safety","type":1},{"tag":"Firm size","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Judgment-proof problem","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-08T14:15:52Z","dateModified":"2018-08-08T14:15:52Z"}},{"key":"8NUL8PIU","version":3504,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8NUL8PIU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8NUL8PIU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bernard L.

This technological shift interacted with local geology to create exogenous shocks to income and employment. We measure the effects of these shocks within the county where production occurs and track their geographic and temporal propagation. Every million dollars of new oil and gas extracted produces $80,000 in wage income, $132,000 in royalty payments and business income, and 0.85 jobs within the county in the year production occurs. Within the region, the economic impacts are approximately three times larger. Within 100 miles of the new production, one million dollars generates $257,000 in wages, $286,000 in royalties and business income, and 2.13 jobs. Thus, over half of the fracking revenue stays within the regional economy. The impacts of new production on wages are relatively persistent over time. Roughly 2/3 of the wage income increase persists two years after the initial shock. New oil and gas extraction increased aggregate US employment by as many as 640,000, implying a 0.43 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession assuming no general equilibrium effects.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"53","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~mansur/papers/feyrer_mansur_sacerdote_frackingjobs.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T15:01:25Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:48:59Z"}},{"key":"3V36CUTI","version":3491,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3V36CUTI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3V36CUTI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Leistritz et al.","parsedDate":"1981-01-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Leistritz, P.

This paper compares alternative energy taxation systems in terms of their implications for local governments and local planning. A fiscal impact simulation model is utilized to evaluate a severance-production tax system and, alternatively, an ad valorem property tax system. The results indicate that the form of taxation system adopted can have a major influence on the fiscal outlook for local governments in areas affected by large scale development projects and thus on the welfare of area residents. These results also suggest that local fiscal considerations should receive careful attention in local planning and policy formulation.","publicationTitle":"Socio-Economic Planning Sciences","volume":"15","issue":"4","pages":"165-174","date":"January 1, 1981","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Socio-Economic Planning Sciences","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/0038-0121(81)90020-3","ISSN":"0038-0121","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038012181900203","accessDate":"2018-08-07T21:47:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T21:47:09Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:47:09Z"}},{"key":"3J66XEZY","version":3484,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3J66XEZY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3J66XEZY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Shellenberger et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Shellenberger, Michael, Ted Nordhaus, Alex Trembath, and Jesse Jenkins. &#x201C;Where the Shale Gas Revolution Came From: Government&#x2019;s Role in the Development of Hydraulic Fracturing in Shale.&#x201D; Breakthrough Institute, 2012. https://thebreakthrough.org/images/main_image/Where_the_Shale_Gas_Revolution_Came_From2.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3J66XEZY","version":3484,"itemType":"report","title":"Where the Shale Gas Revolution Came From: Government's Role in the Development of Hydraulic Fracturing in Shale","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Shellenberger"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Ted Nordhaus"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Alex Trembath"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Jesse Jenkins"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Breakthrough Institute","institution":"","date":"2012","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://thebreakthrough.org/images/main_image/Where_the_Shale_Gas_Revolution_Came_From2.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:52Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:42:17Z"}},{"key":"7YUJ3QIZ","version":3483,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7YUJ3QIZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7YUJ3QIZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"parsedDate":"2016-08-21","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Trophy Hunting vs. Manufacturing Energy: The Price Responsiveness of Shale Gas,&#x201D; August 21, 2016. http://www.rff.org/research/publications/trophy-hunting-vs-manufacturing-energy-price-responsiveness-shale-gas.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7YUJ3QIZ","version":3483,"itemType":"report","title":"Trophy Hunting vs. Manufacturing Energy: The Price Responsiveness of Shale Gas","creators":[],"abstractNote":"Is unconventional natural gas supply more responsive to price changes than conventional gas?

The gloomy, almost crisis-like outlook for the future of domestic natural gas in the late 1970’s set in motion a set of national-level energy initiatives for adding new gas supplies. Two of the most valuable of these were: (1) the joint government/industry R&D programs in tight gas, gas shales and coalbed methane by the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy (DOE/FE) that established the essential exploration and production technology for these resources; and, (2) the unconventional gas economic incentives (Section 29 tax credits) that buffered the economic risks faced by the early set of unconventional gas developers and helped attract scarce investment capital to this emerging resource. Now, twenty years later, unconventional gas offers one of the impressive technology success stories. A poorly understood, high cost energy resource is now providing major volumes of annual gas supplies and helping meet the growing domestic demand for natural gas. Unconventional natural gas provided 4,500 Bcf of supply in 1999, up threefold from about 1,600 Bcf twenty years ago. Proved reserves of unconventional gas are 53 Tcf, up from less than 20 Tcf when the R&D and incentive programs started.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CiteSeer","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T18:05:35Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:41:22Z"}},{"key":"ZTCFQ2GM","version":3480,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZTCFQ2GM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZTCFQ2GM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Chiou-Wei et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Chiou-Wei, Song Zan, Scott C Linn, and Zhen Zhu. &#x201C;The Response of U.S. Natural Gas Futures and Spot Prices to Storage Change Surprises and the Effect of Escalating Physical Gas Production,&#x201D; n.d., 35. https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2012/commodity/pdf/linn.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"ZTCFQ2GM","version":3480,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Response of U.S. Natural Gas Futures and Spot Prices to Storage Change Surprises and the Effect of Escalating Physical Gas Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Song Zan","lastName":"Chiou-Wei"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Scott C","lastName":"Linn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Zhu"}],"abstractNote":"We study the behavior of U.S. natural gas futures and spot prices on and around the weekly announcements by the U.S. Energy Information Administration of the amount of natural gas in storage.

We identify an inverse empirical relation between changes in futures prices and surprises in the change in natural gas in storage and that this relation is not driven by the absolute size of the surprise. We also present direct evidence of price discovery occurring in the futures market for natural gas with that information then flowing to the spot market. We find that post 2005, corresponding to a period of significant increases in the production of natural gas in the United States, the response of prices to storage surprises became more negative. At a more general level our study provides insights into the association between price changes and information about changes in the amount of a commodity or asset held in storage and the implications of these associations for modeling the behavior of commodity prices changes.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"35","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2012/commodity/pdf/linn.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-27T21:08:03Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:40:29Z"}},{"key":"LFKKAC3B","version":3478,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LFKKAC3B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LFKKAC3B","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Holladay and LaRiviere","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Holladay, J Scott, and Jacob LaRiviere. &#x201C;The Effect of Abundant Natural Gas on Air Pollution from Electricity Production,&#x201D; n.d., 45. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ad6/1b3362e3cdb1cc49d70626c48cd67b09acf8.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LFKKAC3B","version":3478,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Effect of Abundant Natural Gas on Air Pollution from Electricity Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"J Scott","lastName":"Holladay"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"LaRiviere"}],"abstractNote":"We estimate the impact of large changes in the relative prices of natural gas and coal from 2005-2011, due primarily to “fracking,” on regional electricity marginal costs and air pollution emissions from electricity producers.

I examine whether\nextracting shale gas changed default probabilities of mortgages in the shale gas region after\na nationwide fracking boom. Utilizing a sample of 371,946 residential mortgages that was\noriginated in Pennsylvania between 2004 and 2011, the analysis provides compelling\nempirical evidence that mortgages originated in the shale gas region after the shale gas boom are\nassociated with a 58% decrease in default probability compared to the state average default rate..\nFindings of my temporal analysis suggest that: (1) borrowers stopped defaulting on mortgages as\nsoon as extracting shale gas became profitable nationwide; and (2) local permitting activities do not\nhave additional impact on borrowers’ default decision. An analysis of mortgages located on a buffer\nbetween fracking region and non-fracking region shows that the effect of fracking on lowering\nmortgage default rate persists even within a 7-mile buffer zone. In a fracking region, GSE-secured\nmortgages, which are farther away from fracking wells than non-GSE loans, are more likely to default\nthan the latter. The importance of my study is twofold: in regard to its direct application to the\nfracking boom, I find no empirical evidence that fracking triggers mortgage default. In addition,\nanalysis of the GSE anti-drilling rule shows that outdated investment standards might be\nharmful in a rapidly changing investment environment.

Since 2008, when the economic viability of shale gas resources first became widely recognized, policymakers and industry leaders have worked to better understand the nature of this resource; the risks and opportunities associated with its production, transport, and use; and the potential strategic implications of the United States’ new energy reality. The paradox of the U.S. unconventional gas story is that the technologies and industry practices that made it possible have been decades in the making; the public policy and commercial landscape is vastly different from just a few years ago; and the story of this remarkable resource development is still in its infancy. In an attempt to capture the current state of play with respect to resource development, operational practices, risk identification and mitigation, impacts assessment and identify strategies that allow this valuable resource to be prudently developed, the CSIS Energy and National Security Program undertook this Unconventional Gas Initiative. Over the course of the past year, the authors were able—in concert with industry and nongovernmental organization (NGO) supporters—to work with a wide array of regulators, policymakers, environmental, industry and financial groups, academics and community stakeholders to capture the latest understanding of the unconventional gas development picture and develop themes and findings in the hope of facilitating an informed discussion on a path forward.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"CSIS Reports","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"en-us","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/realizing-the-potential-of-u-s-unconventional-natural-gas-1","accessDate":"2018-07-28T01:31:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T01:31:05Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T21:06:31Z"}},{"key":"LYGDXFWF","version":3465,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LYGDXFWF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LYGDXFWF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Green","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Green, Kenneth P. &#x201C;Safety in the Transportation of Oil and Gas: Pipelines or Rail?,&#x201D; n.d. https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/safety-in-the-transportation-of-oil-and-gas-pipelines-or-rail-rev2.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"LYGDXFWF","version":3465,"itemType":"report","title":"Safety in the Transportation of Oil and Gas: Pipelines or Rail?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kenneth P","lastName":"Green"}],"abstractNote":"Transporting oil and gas by pipeline or rail is in general quite safe.\n But when the safety of transporting oil and gas by pipelines and rail is\ncompared, taking into consideration the amount of product moved, pipelines are found to be the much safer transportation method.\nSpecifically, rail is found to be over 4.5 times more likely to experience an\noccurrence when compared to pipelines.\n  Over 70 percent of pipeline occurrences result in spills of 1 m3\n or less,\nand only 17 percent of pipeline occurrences take place in actual line pipe,\nmeaning that the vast majority of spills occur in facilities, which may have\nsecondary containment mechanisms and procedures.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"14","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/safety-in-the-transportation-of-oil-and-gas-pipelines-or-rail-rev2.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T14:27:11Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T20:47:41Z"}},{"key":"IGLDEZ5N","version":3461,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IGLDEZ5N","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IGLDEZ5N","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Celebi et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Celebi, Metin, Frank Graves, and Charles Russell. &#x201C;Potential Coal Plant Retirements: 2012 Update,&#x201D; 2012, 13. http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Upload1082.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IGLDEZ5N","version":3461,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Potential Coal Plant Retirements: 2012 Update","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Metin","lastName":"Celebi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Graves"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Russell"}],"abstractNote":"In this study, we have revised our previous coal plant retirement analysis to reflect the most\nrecent market and regulatory outlook facing coal plants.

However expanding its role will depend on regional\nmarket conditions that allow gas to compete autonomously in energy markets which are themselves\nconnected to global energy markets. The future role of gas in Asia will depend on whether\nnatural gas pricing is tied more closely with supply and demand fundamentals in the region.\nThe Asian natural gas market is the fastest‐growing gas market worldwide, and is expected to\nbecome the second‐largest by 2015, with 790 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas demand.\nThe market for natural gas in Asia is dominated by long‐term contracts in which the price of gas is\nlinked, or indexed, to that of oil. Developing countries might require long‐term contracts to\nensure security of supply for their fast‐growing economies, and producers will look to secure\nreturn on their considerable infrastructure investments.  \nIn recent years, this has helped keep Asian gas prices much higher than those in other parts of\nthe world, leading to competitiveness concerns and serious questions about whether such a\nsystem can last. In order to expand its market share, natural gas has to be competitive within the\nenergy mix of the region or country where it is delivered. In Asia, however, current constraints\ninclude the region’s lack of both a trading hub to facilitate the exchange of natural gas, and the\ndevelopment of a transparent price signal to steer investments in natural gas infrastructures.  \nThe confidence in the legitimacy and transparency of natural gas pricing generated on a natural\ngas hub is crucial for investment decisions in such a capital‐intensive industry. This confidence\ncan be derived to a large extent from the institutional and structural requirements put into place,\nbut ultimately it lies in the long‐term resolve of government to allow markets to determine\nnatural gas prices with minimal interference from short‐term political considerations.  \nTo successfully develop a reliable natural gas price in the Asian‐Pacific region would require a\ncompetitive national/regional market, which would then need to meet a set of institutional and\nstructural requirements to create the market confidence to attract new participants (namely\nfinancials) and to encourage market players to use a trading hub for the balancing of their\nportfolios.  \nA “hands‐off” government approach is necessary. This would involve separating transport from\ncommercial activities, price deregulation at the wholesale level, sufficient network capacity and\nnon‐discriminatory access, and a competitive number of market participants with the involvement\nof financial institutions.\nProspects for a competitive wholesale natural gas market in Asia are limited. Even in the most\nmature Asia‐Pacific markets, the basic requirements for a wholesale market are missing, as\ngovernments continue to emphasise security objectives over economic ones. Of the Asia‐Pacific\neconomies reviewed in this paper, Singapore seems the candidate best suited to develop a\ncompetitive natural gas market and trading hub in the medium term.\nA unique characteristic of the natural gas trade in Asia‐Pacific is the limited amount of natural gas\nthat is traded via pipelines, and the region’s growing dependence on the global liquefied natural\ngas (LNG) supply chain. That global LNG market has become decidedly more short‐term oriented\nand flexible over the past decade – a result of the expansion of global LNG production, the\nemergence of global portfolio players and enhanced competition in the Atlantic Basin.  \nAnd yet these Atlantic Basin developments have had a limited impact on supply flexibility in the\nAsia‐Pacific region. A competitive natural gas market in Asia would need an even more flexible\nLNG supply than is currently in place. This will require a continued expansion of shipping availability and third‐party access (TPA) to regasification terminals in the Asia‐Pacific region.\nFurthermore, it would involve relaxing destination clauses in LNG supply contracts that allow for\nmarket segmentation and stiffen the overall supply chain. Any such modification of the contract\nstructure must properly incorporate aspects that preserve investment security.  \nIn the Asia‐Pacific region, competitive natural gas markets and a reliable gas price will not\ndevelop overnight, and will not necessarily lead to lower prices. However, such a development\nwill allow market players in Asia‐Pacific economies to increase portfolio flexibility as natural gas\nmarkets in this region continue to mature.  \nGovernments in the region will need to signal their willingness to facilitate competition further\ndownstream. Singaporean efforts to develop a competitive natural gas market and complementary\ntrading hub might be considered small relative to the size of the entire Asia‐Pacific natural gas\nmarket. However, the example of an alternative market model which is able to adapt global\nsupply changes to the regional market would be a powerful one.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/AsianGasHub_FINAL_WEB.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NNEQ2WE4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T20:08:44Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T20:10:13Z"}},{"key":"QKN6BJXC","version":3447,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QKN6BJXC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QKN6BJXC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Scott R.

We\nfind that more abundant shale gas resources create an environment in which natural gas prices are likely\nto remain attractive to consumers—even as policy advances additional uses of natural gas to reduce\ncarbon dioxide emissions and bolster energy security.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 10-41","institution":"","date":"2010","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-10-41.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T20:05:35Z"}},{"key":"GCA3X69F","version":3442,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GCA3X69F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GCA3X69F","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lee and Plummer","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lee, Tanya, and Elizabeth Plummer. &#x201C;Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties and Their Contribution to School District Tax Revenues: Evidence from Texas.&#x201D; Journal of Property Tax Assessment and Administration, 2011.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GCA3X69F","version":3442,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties and Their Contribution to School District Tax Revenues: Evidence from Texas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Lee"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Plummer"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"Journal of Property Tax Assessment and Administration","websiteType":"","date":"2011","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:49Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T20:03:53Z"}},{"key":"5DSGIT25","version":3441,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5DSGIT25","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5DSGIT25","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jacquet and Kay","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jacquet, Jeffrey, and David Kay. &#x201C;The Unconventional Boomtown: Updating the Impact Model to Fit New Spatial and Temporal Scales.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Rural and Community Development</i> 9 (2014). https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281294326_The_Unconventional_Boomtown_Updating_the_Impact_Model_to_Fit_New_Spatial_and_Temporal_Scales.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"5DSGIT25","version":3441,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Unconventional Boomtown: Updating the impact model to fit new spatial and temporal scales","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Jacquet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Kay"}],"abstractNote":"The boomtown impact model, developed by researchers in the 1970s, implicitly assumes a spatially concentrated, finite resource will be extracted during a near singular event (i.e., the “boom”), followed by a one-time “bust”. This model has been criticized for its lack of realistic longitudinal or macro-level perspective beyond the boom-and-bust, and seems unlikely to transfer successfully to the context of modern hydrocarbon exploitation. Technological innovations have unlocked massive reservoirs of natural gas in many parts of the world that challenge the notion of a geographically concentrated supply that can be quickly exploited. While natural gas prices have plunged and this fuel source is poised to remain economically attractive for some time to come, energy prices are likely to retain their characteristic volatility. Hydrocarbon rich regions and their associated communities are likely to experience repeated waves of mini-booms and mini-busts over the course of decades: a scenario for which the classic one-time boom/bust model may not be well equipped. This development pattern holds profound implications for the types of impacts experienced by residents and the ways in which communities can prepare for them. In this article, we seek to both better define the sets of assumptions that predicate the boomtown impact model, and suggest updates to incorporate more macro-level economic concerns. We review the boomtown impact model for assumptions of rurality and isolation, land ownership and wealth retention, spatial and temporal concentration, and economic drivers and industry behavior. We compare these assumptions against the new reality of unconventional natural gas development, drawing from impacted communities in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania that have experienced some of the new types of impacts. We further describe ways in which the boomtown model might be updated to include characteristics of a more complex energy industry. Finally, we suggest implications for research and rural community development .","publicationTitle":"Journal of Rural and Community Development","volume":"9","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281294326_The_Unconventional_Boomtown_Updating_the_Impact_Model_to_Fit_New_Spatial_and_Temporal_Scales","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:35Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:58:19Z"}},{"key":"GMF7BYV3","version":3440,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GMF7BYV3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GMF7BYV3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lycoming County","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Sociological research dating back to the 1970s links rapid oil and gas development with overburdened municipal services, upended social and cultural patterns, and volatile economic growth. Research on technological risk has demonstrated communities can come to be associated with pollution and contamination, resulting in out-migration, declining amenity-led development, and decreased financial investment. Emerging shale energy case studies in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Texas show a similar, although nuanced, picture of these concerns. Yet, little data exists on the prevalence or magnitude of these risks in the current context of shale gas development. The existing research has largely remained case-based in nature, has not been synthesized across various disciplines, and has not been updated to account for various social and technological trends that have occurred since its publication. This paper offers a critical review of major research endeavors that inform our knowledge of risk to communities from shale energy development, while identifying gaps in our understanding of these risks and areas of research need.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8321-8333","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The discourse surrounding such development recalls quarter-century-old debates about positive and negative implications for the well-being of such energy boomtowns. Potential support or opposition relates to trust in the industry and its regulators, perceived knowledge, and perceived impacts. Our research project takes advantage of the opportunity for a natural experiment in comparing these elements between two spatially adjacent sites with contrasting approaches to gas development: in Pennsylvania, drilling of unconventional natural gas reserves has been proceeding for nearly a decade, whereas, at the time of this writing, drilling has not begun in New York. A mail survey of a random sample of New York and Pennsylvania residents within the Marcellus region revealed important differences between sites. New York residents were more opposed to development, characterized the industry in a more negative light, and were more likely to have engaged in various forms of public participation. In contrast, respondents did not differ by state on their perceived level of knowledge, even though gas development is more advanced in Pennsylvania.

Less examined are communities on the periphery of such development, which experience related impacts unique to their location. Twenty-eight long-time residents from three Bakken periphery communities were interviewed to evaluate social and environmental impact perceptions, including perceived risks of place disruption. Findings suggest that whereas place meanings and identities were disrupted by the oil boom in Bakken core communities, they remain intact in these periphery communities. Findings further suggest periphery residents view their proximal location to the Bakken region as a social and economic “Goldilocks Zone:” close enough to benefit from spillover economic impacts, yet far enough away to avoid serious negative social impacts. This research extends understanding of place disruption and development impacts in energy periphery communities.","publicationTitle":"Society & Natural Resources","volume":"31","issue":"2","pages":"200-217","date":"February 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/08941920.2017.1376138","ISSN":"0894-1920","shortTitle":"Life in the Goldilocks Zone","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2017.1376138","accessDate":"2018-08-07T19:26:43Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bakken","type":1},{"tag":"energy development","type":1},{"tag":"oil development","type":1},{"tag":"place disruption","type":1},{"tag":"place meaning","type":1},{"tag":"qualitative research","type":1},{"tag":"risk","type":1},{"tag":"shale oil","type":1}],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T19:26:43Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:26:43Z"}},{"key":"FSMK65NP","version":3408,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FSMK65NP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FSMK65NP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rickman et al.","parsedDate":"2017-02-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rickman, Dan S., Hongbo Wang, and John V.

Counties with drilling were matched to non-drilling counties with similar population and traffic in the pre-drilling period.\nResults\nHeavily drilled counties in the north experienced 15–23% higher vehicle crash rates in 2010–2012 and 61–65% higher heavy truck crash rates in 2011–2012 than control counties. We estimated 5–23% increases in crash rates when comparing months with drilling and months without, but did not find significant effects on fatalities and major injury crashes. Heavily drilled counties in the southwest showed 45–47% higher rates of fatal and major injury crashes in 2012 than control counties, but monthly comparisons of drilling activity showed no significant differences associated with drilling.\nConclusions\nVehicle accidents have measurably increased in conjunction with shale gas drilling.","publicationTitle":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","volume":"74","issue":"","pages":"203-209","date":"January 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.aap.2014.11.003","ISSN":"0001-4575","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000145751400325X","accessDate":"2018-08-07T19:26:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Marcellus","type":1},{"tag":"Motor vehicle accidents","type":1},{"tag":"Traffic","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T19:26:02Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:26:02Z"}},{"key":"HUBUMFR9","version":3401,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HUBUMFR9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HUBUMFR9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Measham and Fleming","parsedDate":"2014-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Measham, Thomas G., and David A.

Rural decline is defined as comprising loss of rural youth, reduced human capital and increasing rural poverty. Since the start of the current century, the unconventional natural gas industry has been expanding around the world, often in close proximity to pre-existing agricultural communities. The social impacts of this new industry represent a growing area of interest in rural studies. We contribute to this new research area through a case study of coal seam gas (CSG) development in Queensland, Australia, comparing regions where gas development occurred between 2001 and 2011 against a control group of similar regions without gas development. The study eliminated the influence of non-resident workforces by analysing census data based on place of usual residence as well as place of enumeration. A key finding of the study is that regions with CSG development have experienced a growing youth share of the population and, of particular note, a growing female youth share of the population. CSG regions had a higher proportion of youth with university degrees and advanced technical training compared to other rural regions. Poverty reduction was also observed in some specific CSG regions. The extensive spatial footprint of unconventional gas and increased female rural youth populations indicate a diversion from traditional boomtown social impacts observed in previous energy booms. Taken together, the results show signs of mitigating and reversing rural community decline.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Rural Studies","volume":"36","issue":"","pages":"376-385","date":"October 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Rural Studies","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.04.003","ISSN":"0743-0167","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016714000485","accessDate":"2018-08-07T19:25:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"CSG","type":1},{"tag":"Coal-bed methane","type":1},{"tag":"Regional development","type":1},{"tag":"Rural decline","type":1},{"tag":"Rural youth","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T19:25:17Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:25:17Z"}},{"key":"M3IIIZN9","version":3401,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M3IIIZN9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M3IIIZN9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brown et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Through exploring what ethnographic evidence is revealing concerning the impacts of Marcellus shale gas development in Bradford County, in Northeastern Pennsylvania, I illustrate the ways that rapid social and economic change processes are impacting daily lives and community dynamics in one traditionally agricultural and rural place. I provide a broad overview of the social history and current social dynamics in order to understand the significance of the short-term changes agricultural landowners and other local residents have witnessed and experienced. I discuss some of the most significant short-term changes in quality of life as seen by a small group of agricultural landowners, in relation to the cultural significance of place, home, and family, and what this tells us about the sociocultural and psychological impacts of rapid energy development. Finally, I comment on what my ethnographic data show so far with regard to the short- and long-term individual and collective impacts being experienced in this one community.","publicationTitle":"Culture, Agriculture, Food and Environment","volume":"34","issue":"1","pages":"81-92","date":"2012-06-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/j.2153-9561.2012.01066.x","ISSN":"2153-9561","shortTitle":"Development, Land Use, and Collective Trauma","url":"https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-9561.2012.01066.x","accessDate":"2018-08-07T19:19:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2012 by the American Anthropological Association","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"collective trauma","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas development","type":1},{"tag":"social impacts","type":1}],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T19:19:35Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:19:35Z"}},{"key":"8HKSJ85C","version":3388,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8HKSJ85C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8HKSJ85C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Vision West North Dakota","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Recently there has been resurgence in the development of natural gas\nand other alternative energy sources, including wind farms, throughout North America. The\ndevelopment of wind farms require movement of very heavy equipment over low volume, rural\nroads that were often not designed for such loading. The development of natural gas wells,\nespecially those utilizing hydro-fracturing, requires movement of large volumes of moderately\nheavy trucks over similar rural roads. Many local municipalities and provincial highway\ndepartments are concerned about the impact of this truck loading on the life of their roadway\ninfrastructure.\nThis paper summarizes the impact of energy development projects on local road networks. A\nmethod to estimate the cost impact of various types of trucking on pavements is presented.\nAdditionally, methodologies are presented to: quantify pavement conditions before and after\nwind farm/oil and gas well development traffic; determine the need for pre-development\nupgrades, and determine the repairs developers should make or the financial contribution they\nshould pay at the end of the development period for the pavement life that has been consumed.\nAlternative technical approaches, ranging from simplified, conventional pavement testing to\nmore sophisticated methods involving non-destructive testing that have been used recently are\npresented. Finally, the paper presents administrative issues to be considered in road use\nagreements.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Camp Hill, PA","institution":"Applied Research Associates, presented for the 2011 Annual Conference of the Transportation Association of Canada","date":"2011","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://conf.tac-atc.ca/english/annualconference/tac2011/docs/p2/wilke.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:41Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T19:17:33Z"}},{"key":"YDKBBX5F","version":3384,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YDKBBX5F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YDKBBX5F","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Operators have fraced wells for more than fifty years, but the practice has recently grown rapidly in areas like the Barnett Shale of North Central Texas and the Marcellus Shale beneath Pennsylvania, New York, and other Appalachian states.   This Article describes the process of hydraulic fracturing, existing studies of the environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing, and the laws and regulations that apply to the practice.  It argues that there is no direct federal regulation of the fracing process (the pumping of fluids into a wellbore), that court guidance in this area is limited, and that state regulations differ substantially.  Although other general regulations apply to the practice, the Article argues that in light of the dearth of regulation specific to fracturing in some areas, more study of the potential environmental and human health effects of fracing is needed in order to determine whether current regulation is sufficient.  The EPA completed a partial study in 2004, but this Article focuses on the deficiencies of that study and calls for a new, national, scientific study of the practice.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2008/09/23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Untested Waters","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1595092","accessDate":"2018-08-07T13:43:28Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"fracing","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T13:43:28Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:43:47Z"}},{"key":"9Q3BIYNS","version":3382,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9Q3BIYNS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9Q3BIYNS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Richardson et al.","parsedDate":"2013-05-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Richardson, Nathan, Madeline Gottlieb, Alan J.

In the past decade, energy companies have learned to tap previously inaccessible oil and gas in shale with “hydraulic fracturing” (“fracturing” or “fracking”), pumping fluid at high pressure to crack the shale and release gas and oil trapped inside.  This “shale revolution” has created millions of jobs, enhanced our energy independence, and reduced U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by substituting natural gas for coal.  Even so, fracturing is controversial. It may undercut the renewable energy industry, exacerbate air pollution and congestion, and use significant amounts of water. The most unique risk, which is the focus of this Article, is the potential contamination of groundwater. The fluid used in fracturing contains toxic chemicals. There is little evidence so far that subterranean fracturing can directly contaminate groundwater, and this risk may never materialize.  The layer of shale that is fractured is usually thousands of feet below the water table, with a buffer of dense rock or clay in between.  But there are other ways in which fracturing might contaminate groundwater, including surface spills of fracturing fluid, improper handling of waste, and the migration of natural gas into water wells.  Some of these risks are familiar from decades of conventional oil and gas production, while others are new.    In response, this Article proposes a strategy for regulating water contamination from fracturing.  For issues that are already well understood, we would rely on best practices regulations.  For issues that are unique to fracturing and are not yet well understood, we would rely on liability rules – and, specifically, a hybrid of strict liability and a regulatory compliance defense – to motivate industry to take precautions, develop risk-reducing innovations, and cooperate in the development of best practices regulations.  To facilitate more accurate determinations of causation, we recommend information-forcing rules (e.g., requiring energy companies to test water quality before they begin fracturing).  We also suggest other design features for the liability system, such as one-way fee shifting and provisions to ensure that defendants will not be judgment proof.  To ensure that the regulatory regime draws on existing regulatory expertise and is both dynamic and tailored to local conditions, we recommend keeping the regulatory center of gravity in the states, instead of fashioning a new federal regime.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013/11/06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Shale Oil and Gas Revolution, Hydraulic Fracturing, and Water Contamination","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2221025","accessDate":"2018-07-31T04:44:52Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"David M.

In analyzing\nwhether horizontal wells are a reasonably necessary use of the surface, this\nArticle provides a review of various case law and pertinent statutory\nauthority addressing the use of the surface to produce underlying minerals.\nAfter examining modern trends in statutory and regulatory laws addressing the use of horizontal drilling technology, this Article concludes by providing recommendations for a statutory framework that addresses both the need to effectively develop minerals as new technologies emerge, as well as appropriate compensation to surface owners as a result of any\nincreased burden resulting from the use of new drilling technologies.","publicationTitle":"NDL Rev.","volume":"88","issue":"","pages":"595","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://law.und.edu/_files/docs/ndlr/pdf/issues/88/3/88ndlr595.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:06Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:33:53Z"}},{"key":"4I9WBYEW","version":3355,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4I9WBYEW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4I9WBYEW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. &#x201C;Summary of State Statutes and Regulations,&#x201D; 2013.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4I9WBYEW","version":3355,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Summary of State Statutes and Regulations","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"2013","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:31Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:27:31Z"}},{"key":"M48BDAZA","version":3351,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M48BDAZA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M48BDAZA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zirogiannis et al.","parsedDate":"2016-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zirogiannis, Nikolaos, Jessica Alcorn, John Rupp, Sanya Carley, and John D.

State policymakers vary in how they design regulatory policies to balance the anticipated risks and benefits, few attempts have been made, however, to evaluate the heterogeneity in state unconventional gas regulations. In this analysis, we develop a framework for comparing states based on how intensely they regulate unconventional gas development. We utilize two separate but complementary methodological approaches to investigate regulatory heterogeneity: an expert elicitation survey and principal components analysis. Our results indicate that, even though there is significant heterogeneity in state regulatory systems, there exist clusters of states that are consistently ranked at the top or the bottom along a continuum of regulatory stringency. States such as West Virginia, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico and Pennsylvania are found at the top of this scale, while at the lower end we find California, Tennessee, Mississippi and Montana. As states refine their regulatory systems, these rankings can be updated to reflect new policy and regulatory priorities.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"11","issue":"","pages":"142-154","date":"January 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2015.09.009","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"State regulation of unconventional gas development in the U.S.","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462961530061X","accessDate":"2018-08-07T13:03:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Expert elicitation","type":1},{"tag":"Principle components analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Regulatory stringency","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional gas development","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T13:03:34Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:03:34Z"}},{"key":"XP5FJ2JT","version":3347,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XP5FJ2JT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XP5FJ2JT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Norvell","parsedDate":"1961","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Norvell, James R. &#x201C;Railroad Commission of Texas; Its Origin and Relation to the Oil and Gas Industry.&#x201D; Tex.

This new technique has radically changed the energy future of the United States. The U.S. has shifted from a waning producer of natural gas to a growing producer. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2035 nearly half of U.S. natural gas will come from shale gas. Texas is a major player in these developments. Of the eight states and coastal areas that account for the bulk of U.S. gas, Texas has the largest proved reserves. Texas' Barnett Shale already produces six percent of the continental U.S.' gas and exploration of Texas' other shale gas regions is just beginning. Shale gas production is highly controversial, in part because of environmental concerns. Some U.S. states have put hydraulic fracturing moratoriums in place because of fear of drinking water contamination. The federal government has gotten involved and some states, like Texas, have accused it of overreaching. The contention over shale gas drilling in the U.S. may be a bellwether for other parts of the world that are now moving forward with their own shale gas production.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"2974-2981","date":"May 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Regulating hydraulic fracturing in shale gas plays","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511001893","accessDate":"2018-07-30T16:21:07Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Regulation","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-30T16:21:07Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:02:01Z"}},{"key":"QSG9N5SM","version":3347,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QSG9N5SM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QSG9N5SM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fleming and Reins","parsedDate":"2016-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fleming, Ruven C., and Leonie Reins. &#x201C;Shale Gas Extraction, Precaution and Prevention: A Conversation on Regulatory Responses.&#x201D; <i>Energy Research &amp; Social Science</i>, Risks, the Social Sciences, and Unconventional Hydrocarbons, 20 (October 1, 2016): 131&#x2013;41. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2016.05.013.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"QSG9N5SM","version":3347,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Shale gas extraction, precaution and prevention: A conversation on regulatory responses","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ruven C.","lastName":"Fleming"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Leonie","lastName":"Reins"}],"abstractNote":"Shale gas in the EU and its Member States faces increasing attention from a regulatory perspective. Questions about the role of law regarding the development of shale gas extraction in Europe are being asked. The role of law within science, as Laurie et al. suggest, involves an important decision: “whether the law is an enabler or a prohibitor of technologies” (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [1]. At best, the law should promote the development of a technology without unduly compromising the protection of society and the environment from consequences of uncertainties and potential threats of an associated technology (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [2]. The principles of precaution and prevention are the two main tools of European law, which shall help to strike a balance between enabling and prohibiting the development of an emerging energy technology like shale gas extraction. This article departs from the perspective that law at EU level is imposing control on the management of “known” risks via the preventive principle. Regarding “uncertainties” or “unknowns”, decision makers are legally obliged to be guided by the precautionary principle. This paper discusses the two environmental law principles – precaution or prevention – and contemplates which of them would be most apt for guiding the regulation of shale gas extraction in Europe. It concludes that regulation on shale gas extraction could be based on either of these principles for different reasons.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"20","issue":"","pages":"131-141","date":"October 1, 2016","series":"Risks, the Social Sciences, and Unconventional Hydrocarbons","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.05.013","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Shale gas extraction, precaution and prevention","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616301116","accessDate":"2018-08-07T13:01:44Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Precaution","type":1},{"tag":"Prevention","type":1},{"tag":"Risk management","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["NNEQ2WE4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T13:01:45Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T13:01:47Z"}},{"key":"CVMG8ZUQ","version":3345,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CVMG8ZUQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CVMG8ZUQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Turgeon","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Turgeon, Elizabeth. &#x201C;Goin to Carlina in My Mind: Prospects and Perils for Natural Gas Drilling in North Carolina&#x201D; 13 (n.d.): 37. http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211&amp;context=ncjolt.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"CVMG8ZUQ","version":3345,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Goin to Carlina in My Mind: Prospects and Perils for Natural Gas Drilling in North Carolina","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Turgeon"}],"abstractNote":"The hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies\nutilized in the extraction of natural gas have proven controversial,\nparticularly in states where the legal infrastructure is unprepared\nto accommodate the industry.

Shale gas drilling began in Texas and is expanding throughout the U.S. and globally. In Texas and other regions, large population centers overlie these deposits. As a result, city residents increasingly come into contact with extraction activities. The proximity of drilling activities to residential areas raises a number of concerns, including noise, dust and emissions hazards, public safety, diminished quality of life, and effects on neighborhood aesthetics and property values. Cities in Texas address these concerns through setback ordinances that regulate the distance between gas wells and residences, schools, floodplains, etc. Although the state of Texas permits drilling 200ft (61m) from residences, many municipalities in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW) have established longer setback distances. This paper analyzes the purpose and basis for setback distances among 26 municipalities in DFW. Findings show that there is no uniform setback distance, distances have increased over time, and, rather than technically-based, setbacks are political compromises. For policy makers confronted with urban shale gas drilling, deriving setback distances from advanced emissions monitoring could decrease setback distance ambiguity.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"62","issue":"","pages":"79-89","date":"November 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.107","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513007507","accessDate":"2018-08-07T12:41:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Setback distances","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Urban drilling","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T12:41:31Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T12:41:31Z"}},{"key":"WUEY5NLD","version":3339,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WUEY5NLD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WUEY5NLD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Azzedine Layachi","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Azzedine Layachi. &#x201C;The Changing Geopolitics of Natural Gas: The Case of Algeria.&#x201D; Accessed August 7, 2018. https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/changing-geopolitics-natural-gas-case-algeria.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WUEY5NLD","version":3339,"itemType":"report","title":"The Changing Geopolitics of Natural Gas: The Case of Algeria","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Azzedine Layachi"}],"abstractNote":"Part of a joint study by the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute and Harvard University's Kennedy School on the geopolitical implications of natural gas.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"The Changing Geopolitics of Natural Gas","url":"https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/changing-geopolitics-natural-gas-case-algeria","accessDate":"2018-08-07T00:53:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NNEQ2WE4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-07T00:53:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T00:55:07Z"}},{"key":"U947D5RJ","version":3334,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U947D5RJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U947D5RJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Erickson and Lazarus","parsedDate":"2018-02-22","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Erickson, Peter, and Michael Lazarus. &#x201C;Would Constraining US Fossil Fuel Production Affect Global CO2 Emissions?

By some estimates, global consumption and production of fossil fuels—particularly coal and oil—will need to end almost entirely within 50 years. Given the scale of such a transition, nations may need to consider policies that constrain growth in fossil fuel supplies in addition to those that reduce demand. Here, we examine the emissions implications of a supply-constraining measure that was rapidly gaining momentum in the United States (US) under the Obama administration: ceasing the issuance of new leases for fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters. Such a measure could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 280 million tons annually by 2030, comparable to that of other major climate policies adopted or considered by the Obama administration. Our findings suggest that measures to constrain fossil fuel supply—though not currently viable in a US Trump administration—deserve further consideration at subnational levels in the US or by other countries now, and by future US administrations.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"1-14","date":"2018/02/22","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-018-2152-z","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-018-2152-z","accessDate":"2018-04-16T20:44:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK","SFLUS5I4","NNEQ2WE4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-16T20:44:45Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T00:51:43Z"}},{"key":"3L47YLII","version":3332,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3L47YLII","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3L47YLII","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"H Pifer","parsedDate":"2011-05-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">H Pifer, Ross. &#x201C;What a Short, Strange Trip It&#x2019;s Been: Moving Forward after Five Years of Marcellus Shale Development.&#x201D; <i>University of Pittsburgh Law Review</i> 72 (May 7, 2011). https://doi.org/10.5195/lawreview.2011.167.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3L47YLII","version":3332,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"What a Short, Strange Trip It's Been: Moving Forward after Five Years of Marcellus Shale Development","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ross","lastName":"H Pifer"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"University of Pittsburgh Law Review","volume":"72","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 7, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.5195/lawreview.2011.167","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"What a Short, Strange Trip It's Been","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274671054_What_a_Short_Strange_Trip_It%27s_Been_Moving_Forward_after_Five_Years_of_Marcellus_Shale_Development","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ResearchGate","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:30:01Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T00:51:12Z"}},{"key":"L22GRLGU","version":3331,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/L22GRLGU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/L22GRLGU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Metcalf","parsedDate":"2016-08","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Metcalf, Gilbert E. &#x201C;The Impact of Removing Tax Preferences for US Oil and Gas Production.&#x201D; Council on Foreign Relations, August 2016. https://www.cfr.org/report/impact-removing-tax-preferences-us-oil-and-gas-production.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"L22GRLGU","version":3331,"itemType":"report","title":"The Impact of Removing Tax Preferences for US Oil and Gas Production","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gilbert E.","lastName":"Metcalf"}],"abstractNote":"The tax treatment of oil and gas investment in the United States has been a contentious policy issue for decades. Reform advocates argue that eliminating tax preferences for producers of oil and gas could increase government revenues by billions of dollars each year while defenders of the existing tax regime contend that changing it would lead to large declines in domestic oil and gas production and to significant job destruction. Against the backdrop of low oil prices and increased domestic production, Gilbert E. Metcalf models firm behavior in response to the potential loss of each of the three major tax preferences in the United States. The potential losses are measured as equivalent price impact (EPI), the percentage drop in the price of oil or gas that would reduce the profitability of drilling a well as much as tax reform would.\nThe author finds that removing tax preferences would increase the global price of oil by only 1 percent by 2030. Domestic oil production could drop 5 percent and global consumption could fall by less than 1 percent in that timeframe. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas prices could rise between 7 and 10 percent, and both domestic gas production and consumption could fall between 3 and 4 percent. The author concludes that the estimated effects of removing the preferences on energy prices, domestic production, and global consumption suggest that none of the three preferences directly and materially improve U.S. energy security or mitigate climate change. If eliminated, however, they could enhance U.S. influence to advocate for international climate action and generate fiscal savings.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Council on Foreign Relations","institution":"","date":"August 2016","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.cfr.org/report/impact-removing-tax-preferences-us-oil-and-gas-production","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:05Z","dateModified":"2018-08-07T00:01:46Z"}},{"key":"RCW26CU3","version":3328,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RCW26CU3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RCW26CU3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Entin","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Entin, Jonathan E. &#x201C;The Law and Policy of Hydraulic Fracturing: Addressing the Issues of the Natural Gas Boom - Introduction.&#x201D; <i>Case Western Reserve Law Review</i> 63, no. 4 (n.d.): 7. https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1221&amp;context=caselrev.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"RCW26CU3","version":3328,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Law and Policy of Hydraulic Fracturing: Addressing the Issues of the Natural Gas Boom - Introduction","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan E","lastName":"Entin"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Case Western Reserve Law Review","volume":"63","issue":"4","pages":"7","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1221&context=caselrev","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T19:25:06Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T23:59:11Z"}},{"key":"AMCWANYP","version":3327,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AMCWANYP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AMCWANYP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"III and HARTLEY","parsedDate":"2011-07-19","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">III, KENNETH B.

Multiple studies completed as early as 1994 and as recently as June\n2007 indicate that the U.S. government take in the Gulf of Mexico is lower\nthan that of most other fiscal systems. For example, data GAO evaluated from\na June 2007 industry consulting firm report indicated that the government\ntake in the deep water U.S. Gulf of Mexico ranked 93rd lowest of 104 oil and\ngas fiscal systems evaluated. Generally, other measures indicate that the\nUnited States is an attractive target for oil and gas investment.\n\nThe lack of price flexibility in royalty rates—automatic adjustment of these\nrates to changes in oil and gas prices or other market conditions—and the\ninability to change fiscal terms on existing leases have put pressure on\nInterior and the Congress to change royalty rates in the past on an ad hoc\nbasis with consequences that could amount to billions of dollars of foregone\nrevenue. For example, royalty relief granted on leases issued in the deep\nwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico between 1996 and 2000—a period when oil\nand gas prices and industry profits were much lower than they are today—\ncould cost the federal government between $21 billion and $53 billion,\ndepending on the outcome of ongoing litigation challenging the authority of\nInterior to place price thresholds that would remove the royalty relief offered\non certain leases. Further, royalty rate increases in 2007 are expected to\ngenerate modest increases in federal revenues from future leases offered in\nthe Gulf of Mexico. However, in choosing to increase royalty rates, Interior\ndid not evaluate the entire oil and gas fiscal system to determine whether or\nnot these increases strike the proper balance between the attractiveness of\nfederal leases for investment and appropriate returns to the federal\ngovernment for oil and gas resources.\n\nInterior does not routinely evaluate the federal oil and gas fiscal system,\nmonitor what other governments or resource owners are receiving for their\nenergy resources, or evaluate and compare the attractiveness of federal lands\nand waters for oil and gas investment with that of other oil and gas regions. As\na result, Interior cannot assess whether or not there is a proper balance\nbetween the attractiveness of federal leases for investment and appropriate\nreturns to the federal government for oil and gas resources. Specifically,\nInterior does not have procedures in place for evaluating the ranking of (1)\nthe federal oil and gas fiscal system or (2) industry rates of return on federal\nleases against other resource owners. Interior also does not have the authority\nto alter tax components of the oil and gas fiscal system. All these factors are\nessential to inform decisions about whether or how to alter the federal oil and\ngas fiscal system in response to changing market conditions.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Washington, DC","institution":"","date":"2008","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.gao.gov/assets/280/279991.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:17Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T23:39:37Z"}},{"key":"WPIILVEH","version":3316,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WPIILVEH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WPIILVEH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Aldy","parsedDate":"2014-04-11","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Doherty, an independent oil and gas executive, was undoubtedly a\nmajor stimulus in the creation of the OCB.3\n In 1926, the OCB held hearings on\nthe need for a federal statutory unitization law in order to prevent the very wasteful practices that Mr. Doherty asserted were a threat to national security.4\nAt the hearings, the American Petroleum Institute hired former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes to argue against a federal role in regulating oil and gas\ndevelopment.5\n The industry was successful in limiting future OCB activities to\nstudies and hearings, and when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was\ninaugurated in 1933, he did not reappoint members of his Cabinet to the\nBoard.6\n The OCB studies may have been instrumental in supporting the\ninclusion of voluntary unitization provisions in the temporary Mineral Leasing\nAct of 1930,7\n the Mineral Leasing Act of 1931,8\n and the compulsory unitization\nprovisions passed in 1935 as an amendment to the 1931 Act.9\n President\nRoosevelt, as part of his New Deal legislation, created a Petroleum Code that\nwas designed to deal with postproduction issues consistent with the regulatory\napproach taken under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA).10 The fate\nof the Petroleum Code, as well as all of the other codes adopted under the aegis\nof the NIRA, was sealed by the Supreme Court’s decision in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, holding that Title 1 of the NIRA was unconstitutional because it amounted to an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the Executive Branch.11 Thus, the decades of the 1930s and 1940s became ones where states responded to the lack of federal regulation with the enactment of state oil and gas conservation statutes that delegated to state agencies broadened powers to regulate the oil and gas industry.12","publicationTitle":"TEXAS TECH LAW REVIEW","volume":"44","issue":"","pages":"26","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://texastechlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/Kramer.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:45:40Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T20:59:58Z"}},{"key":"N633ZV23","version":3307,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/N633ZV23","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/N633ZV23","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Allaire and Brown","parsedDate":"2009","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Allaire, Maura, and Stephen Brown. &#x201C;Eliminating Subsidies for Fossil Fuel Production: Implications for U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Markets.&#x201D; Resources for the Future Issue Brief 09-10, 2009. https://www.wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/OilSubsidiesCost.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"N633ZV23","version":3307,"itemType":"report","title":"Eliminating Subsidies for Fossil Fuel Production: Implications for U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Markets","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maura","lastName":"Allaire"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Brown"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Resources for the Future Issue Brief 09-10","institution":"","date":"2009","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/OilSubsidiesCost.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:43Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T20:58:10Z"}},{"key":"8RU8L2VV","version":3306,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8RU8L2VV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8RU8L2VV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Joode and Van Oostvoorn","parsedDate":"2007-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Joode, Jeroen, and Frits Van Oostvoorn. &#x201C;Conditions for Investments in Natural Gas Infrastructure.&#x201D; <i>Working Paper, Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands</i>, January 1, 2007. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228766577_Conditions_for_investments_in_natural_gas_infrastructure?enrichId=rgreq-5a278d87baa13c5e38272f61a67af4dd-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzIyODc2NjU3NztBUzoyMTg4MzgwNTEzNjQ4NjdAMTQyOTE4NjQ2NTU5OA%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"8RU8L2VV","version":3306,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Conditions for investments in natural gas infrastructure","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Joode"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Frits","lastName":"Van Oostvoorn"}],"abstractNote":"The European Commission (EC) has acknowledged the importance of securing gas supplies from neighboring regions for quite some time. Within the TEN-E program a number of so-called priority gas infrastructure projects are identified. In the research project Encouraged 2 under the EU 6FP, the objectives are (i) to assess the economic optimal energy interconnections and network infrastructure of the EU with and through neighboring regions, (ii) identify, quantify and evaluate the barriers and potential benefits of optimal energy corridors, and (iii) recommend necessary policy measures aimed at realization of optimal energy corridors. This paper deals with the economic conditions for investments in natural gas infrastructures. Herein we focus on barriers for investing in gas corridors and the role of long-term contracts, unbundling of gas trading and transmission activities and the role of coordination on regional level etc. We especially recommend a more strict, swift and uniform implementation of the EU gas Directive amongst which a full ownership unbundling of trading and transmission activities and a larger role for coordination as an instrument for supporting the timely realization of these often large cross borders projects.","publicationTitle":"Working Paper, Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 1, 2007","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228766577_Conditions_for_investments_in_natural_gas_infrastructure?enrichId=rgreq-5a278d87baa13c5e38272f61a67af4dd-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzIyODc2NjU3NztBUzoyMTg4MzgwNTEzNjQ4NjdAMTQyOTE4NjQ2NTU5OA%3D%3D&el=1_x_2&_esc=publicationCoverPdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ResearchGate","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NNEQ2WE4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-06T20:52:31Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T20:53:23Z"}},{"key":"FUQ5S2SI","version":3302,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FUQ5S2SI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FUQ5S2SI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ellis","parsedDate":"2015-11","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ellis, Colter. &#x201C;Socially Responsible Drilling: Perspectives of Industry Representatives in the Eagle Ford Shale,&#x201D; November 2015. http://www.shsu.edu/dotAsset/170a5b8f-6554-46a1-b41b-fcab3f5be2f3.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FUQ5S2SI","version":3302,"itemType":"report","title":"Socially Responsible Drilling: Perspectives of Industry Representatives in the Eagle Ford Shale","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Colter","lastName":"Ellis"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"November 2015","pages":"37","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.shsu.edu/dotAsset/170a5b8f-6554-46a1-b41b-fcab3f5be2f3.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:53:26Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T20:48:16Z"}},{"key":"IB48WHHF","version":3291,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IB48WHHF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IB48WHHF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Small et al.","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Small, Mitchell J., Paul C.

For the principal domains of risk, we identify observed and potential hazards and promising mitigation options to address them, characterizing current knowledge and research needs. Important unresolved research questions are identified for each area of risk; however, certain domains exhibit especially acute deficits of knowledge and attention, including integrated studies of public health, ecosystems, air quality, socioeconomic impacts on communities, and climate change. For these, current research and analysis are insufficient to either confirm or preclude important impacts. The rapidly evolving landscape of shale gas governance in the U.S. is also assessed, noting challenges and opportunities associated with the current decentralized (state-focused) system of regulation. We briefly review emerging approaches to shale gas governance in other nations, and consider new governance initiatives and options in the U.S. involving voluntary industry certification, comprehensive development plans, financial instruments, and possible future federal roles. In order to encompass the multiple relevant disciplines, address the complexities of the evolving shale gas system and reduce the many key uncertainties needed for improved management, a coordinated multiagency federal research effort will need to be implemented.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8289-8297","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The\nNewark East Fort Worth Basin field–called in the vernacular, the Barnett Shale–in north-central Texas is one\nof the largest unconventional natural gas fields (by production volume) in the United States. Unlike many\nconventional energy development projects, which typically occurred in small rural areas, much of the Barnett\nShale production is occurring in and around a highly urbanized geographical setting. In spite of recent efforts\nto assess the economic effects of Barnett Shale production, little attention has been directed toward\nunderstanding the social impacts associated with this immense unconventional energy development. In this\narticle we use key informant interview data collected in two Barnett Shale counties to investigate the reported\npositive and negative outcomes of unconventional energy development, as well as the similarities and\ndifferences in perceptions between respondents from each of the study counties.

This innovation merits examination because it generates opportunities and challenges – in tension – for regions experiencing UOG development. HZD allows operators to condense their surface impacts by drilling multiple wells per pad. This consolidation benefits the many in a given extractive area, but at the expense of the few who live near intensified sites. HZD also allows operators to more flexibly position these large well pads. Combined, these drilling innovations are further splintering an already fragmented UOG governance space and creating novel procedural fairness challenges, especially in cities. This study offers the concept of “piecemeal participation” to describe these challenges, drawing from a case study in Colorado. Piecemeal participation occurs when governments structure public input on a site-by-site basis, while operators, leveraging HZD's reach and flexibility, plan drilling and weigh alternative drilling locations at the scale of the city. The analysis evaluates piecemeal participation using standard procedural fairness criteria, generating findings of broader relevance as urban areas anticipate UOG development and HZD worldwide.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"469-480","date":"September 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.074","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Horizontal drilling, changing patterns of extraction, and piecemeal participation","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518302842","accessDate":"2018-08-06T19:56:57Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Horizontal drilling","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Procedural fairness","type":1},{"tag":"Public participation","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas development","type":1},{"tag":"Urban hydrocarbon governance","type":1}],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-06T19:56:57Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T19:56:57Z"}},{"key":"PNWGEUG7","version":3279,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PNWGEUG7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Walsh and Zoback","parsedDate":"2015-06-18","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Walsh, F.

In three study areas that encompass the vast majority of the recent seismicity, we show that the increases in seismicity follow 5- to 10-fold increases in the rates of saltwater disposal. Adjacent areas where there has been relatively little saltwater disposal have had comparatively few recent earthquakes. In the areas of seismic activity, the saltwater disposal principally comes from “produced” water, saline pore water that is coproduced with oil and then injected into deeper sedimentary formations. These formations appear to be in hydraulic communication with potentially active faults in crystalline basement, where nearly all the earthquakes are occurring. Although most of the recent earthquakes have posed little danger to the public, the possibility of triggering damaging earthquakes on potentially active basement faults cannot be discounted.Keywords","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"1","issue":"5","pages":"","date":"2015-06-18 00:00:00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1500195","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Oklahoma’s recent earthquakes and saltwater disposal","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/advances/1/5/e1500195.full.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/V9N7RS5C"},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T15:30:59Z"}},{"key":"ZUHJASUG","version":3275,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZUHJASUG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZUHJASUG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Western Values Project","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Western Values Project. &#x201C;Sagebrush Country and Oil and Gas Country Can Coexist,&#x201D; n.d. http://westernvaluesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WVP-Compatibility-Report-Final.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"ZUHJASUG","version":3275,"itemType":"report","title":"Sagebrush Country and Oil and Gas Country Can Coexist","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Western Values Project"}],"abstractNote":"In recent months, communities, businesses and elected officials throughout the\nWest have collaborated in an unprecedented federal and state planning effort to\nconserve the habitat of the Greater sage-grouse, a ground-dwelling sagebrush species\nwhose rapid decline has made it a potential candidate for listing under the Endangered\nSpecies Act. Because western economies are dependent on the sagebrush\necosystem and the numerous activities it supports—including recreation, tourism,\nranching, and energy development—stakeholders have come together from all levels\n(local, state, and federal) in an effort to avoid the need for a listing.\nHowever, throughout this cooperative process, some lobbyists for oil and gas\ncompanies have repeatedly claimed that the Department of the Interior’s proposed\nplans to protect the bird would prohibit oil and gas development on large amounts\nof western public lands. As our new analysis shows, that claim does not square\nwith the reality on the ground in the West, where there is ample room for both\nresponsible energy development and sage-grouse conservation.\nLast October, Western Values Project released a report showing how responsible\nenergy development is indeed compatible with the long-term conservation of\nGreater sage-grouse. The report found almost no overlap between areas being targeted\nfor energy development and key sage-grouse habitat areas, and additionally\nfound that in the few areas where there was overlap, only 2% of the existing leases\nwere actually producing oil or gas. Given these results, we predicted that forthcoming\nmanagement plans from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)—the agency\nresponsible for managing over 50 million acres of sagebrush habitat across eleven\nwestern states—could provide ample protections for the Greater sage-grouse without\nhindering energy development on public lands.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://westernvaluesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WVP-Compatibility-Report-Final.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-06T15:05:13Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T15:07:06Z"}},{"key":"D2R9MVFT","version":3272,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/D2R9MVFT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/D2R9MVFT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Water Withdrawals for Development of Marcellus Shale Gas in Pennsylvania.&#x201D; Accessed July 30, 2018. https://extension.psu.edu/water-withdrawals-for-development-of-marcellus-shale-gas-in-pennsylvania.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"D2R9MVFT","version":3272,"itemType":"report","title":"Water Withdrawals for Development of Marcellus Shale Gas in Pennsylvania","creators":[],"abstractNote":"This article is an introduction to Pennsylvania's water resources and the impact of deep well drilling on those resources.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://extension.psu.edu/water-withdrawals-for-development-of-marcellus-shale-gas-in-pennsylvania","accessDate":"2018-07-30T22:55:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-30T22:55:20Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T15:03:33Z"}},{"key":"356882PG","version":3271,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/356882PG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/356882PG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mielke et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mielke, Erik, Laura Diaz Anadon, and Venkatesh Narayanamurti. &#x201C;Water Consumption of Energy Resource Extraction, Processing, and Conversion.&#x201D; Accessed July 28, 2018. https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/ETIP-DP-2010-15-final-4.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"356882PG","version":3271,"itemType":"report","title":"Water Consumption of Energy Resource Extraction, Processing, and Conversion","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Mielke"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Laura Diaz","lastName":"Anadon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Narayanamurti"}],"abstractNote":"This paper provides an overview of water consumption for different sources of energy, including extraction, processing, and conversion of resources, fuels, and technologies.

A single well can generate millions of liters of wastewater, representing a mixture of formation brine and injected hydraulic fracturing fluids. One of the most common methods for wastewater disposal is underground injection; we are assessing potential risks of this method through an intensive, interdisciplinary study at an injection disposal facility in West Virginia. In June 2014, waters collected downstream from the site had elevated specific conductance (416 μS/cm) and Na, Cl, Ba, Br, Sr, and Li concentrations, compared to upstream, background waters (conductivity, 74 μS/cm). Elevated TDS, a marker of UOG wastewater, provided an early indication of impacts in the stream. Wastewater inputs are also evident by changes in 87Sr/86Sr in streamwater adjacent to the disposal facility. Sediments downstream from the facility were enriched in Ra and had high bioavailable Fe(III) concentrations relative to upstream sediments. Microbial communities in downstream sediments had lower diversity and shifts in composition. Although the hydrologic pathways were not able to be assessed, these data provide evidence demonstrating that activities at the disposal facility are impacting a nearby stream and altering the biogeochemistry of nearby ecosystems.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"11","pages":"5517-5525","date":"June 7, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The potential for surface water quality degradation has been discussed in prior work, although no empirical analysis of this issue has been published. The potential for large-scale surface water quality degradation has affected regulatory approaches to shale gas development in some US states, despite the dearth of evidence. This paper conducts a large-scale examination of the extent to which shale gas development activities affect surface water quality. Focusing on the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we estimate the effect of shale gas wells and the release of treated shale gas waste by permitted treatment facilities on observed downstream concentrations of chloride (Cl−) and total suspended solids (TSS), controlling for other factors. Results suggest that (i) the treatment of shale gas waste by treatment plants in a watershed raises downstream Cl− concentrations but not TSS concentrations, and (ii) the presence of shale gas wells in a watershed raises downstream TSS concentrations but not Cl− concentrations. These results can inform future voluntary measures taken by shale gas operators and policy approaches taken by regulators to protect surface water quality as the scale of this economically important activity increases.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","issue":"13","pages":"4962-4967","date":"2013/03/26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1213871110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/13/4962","accessDate":"2018-08-06T14:58:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Rapidly expanding drilling in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania has significantly increased the volume of produced water that must be managed. Produced water management may include treatment followed by surface water discharge, such as at publically owned wastewater treatment plants (POTWs) or centralized brine treatment plants (CWTs). The use of POTWs and CWTs that discharge partially treated produced water has the potential to increase salt loads to surface waters significantly. These loads may cause unacceptably high concentrations of dissolved solids or bromide in source waters, particularly when rivers are at low-flow conditions. The present study evaluates produced water management in Pennsylvania from 2006 through 2011 to determine whether surface water discharges were sufficient to cause salt or bromide loads that would negatively affect drinking water sources. The increase in produced water that occurred in 2008 in Pennsylvania was accompanied by an increase in use of CWTs and POTWs that were exempt from discharge limits on dissolved solids. Estimates of salt loads associated with produced water and with discharges from CWTs and POTWs in 2008 and 2009 indicate that more than 50% of the total dissolved solids in the produced water generated in those years were released to surface water systems. Especially during the low-flow conditions of 2008 and 2009, these loads would be expected to affect drinking water.Environmental Practice 14:1–13 (2012)","publicationTitle":"Environmental Practice","volume":"14","issue":"4","pages":"288-300","date":"2012/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1017/S1466046612000427","ISSN":"1466-0466, 1466-0474","shortTitle":"RESEARCH ARTICLE","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-practice/article/research-article-oil-and-gas-produced-water-management-and-surface-drinking-water-sources-in-pennsylvania/4CD070C0887BBB5406C8F247B8CE1A88","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:15:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge Core","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T04:15:02Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T14:57:43Z"}},{"key":"95YZJVT4","version":3257,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/95YZJVT4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/95YZJVT4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cooley and Donnelly","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cooley, Heather, and Kristina Donnelly. &#x201C;Hydraulic Fracturing and Water Resources: Separating the Frack from the Fiction.&#x201D; Accessed July 28, 2018. http://pacinst.org/publication/hydraulic-fracturing-and-water-resources-separating-the-frack-from-the-fiction/.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"95YZJVT4","version":3257,"itemType":"report","title":"Hydraulic Fracturing and Water Resources: Separating the Frack from the Fiction","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Cooley"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kristina","lastName":"Donnelly"}],"abstractNote":"Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” has generated growing controversy in the past few years.

Improved drilling and extraction technologies (horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing) have led to rapid and extensive natural gas development in areas overlying the Marcellus Shale. The expansion of hydraulic fracturing poses multiple threats to surface waters, which can be tied to key ecological attributes that limit brook trout populations. Here, we expand current conceptual models to identify three potential pathways of risk between surface water threats associated with increased natural gas development and life history attributes of brook trout: hydrological, physical, and chemical. Our goal is to highlight research needs for fisheries scientists and work in conjunction with resource managers to influence the development of strategies that will preserve brook trout habitat and address Marcellus Shale gas development threats to eastern North America's only native stream salmonid.","publicationTitle":"Fisheries","volume":"38","issue":"1","pages":"4-15","date":"February 4, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/03632415.2013.750112","ISSN":"0363-2415","shortTitle":"Hydraulic Fracturing and Brook Trout Habitat in the Marcellus Shale Region","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03632415.2013.750112","accessDate":"2018-08-06T14:54:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-06T14:54:59Z","dateModified":"2018-08-06T14:54:59Z"}},{"key":"H2VZ5NXH","version":3253,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H2VZ5NXH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H2VZ5NXH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ceres","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ceres. &#x201C;Hydraulic Fracturing &amp; Water Stress: Growing Competitive Pressures for Water.&#x201D; Accessed April 10, 2018. https://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/hydraulic-fracturing-water-stress-growing-competitive-pressures-water.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"H2VZ5NXH","version":3253,"itemType":"report","title":"Hydraulic Fracturing & Water Stress: Growing Competitive Pressures for Water","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Ceres"}],"abstractNote":"This Ceres research paper analyzes water use in hydraulic fracturing operations across the United States and the extent to which this activity is taking place in water stressed regions.

Since HFW is typically characterized by elevated salinity, concerns have been raised whether the high bromide and iodide in HFW may promote the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and alter their speciation to more toxic brominated and iodinated analogues. This study evaluated the minimum volume percentage of two Marcellus Shale and one Fayetteville Shale HFWs diluted by fresh water collected from the Ohio and Allegheny Rivers that would generate and/or alter the formation and speciation of DBPs following chlorination, chloramination, and ozonation treatments of the blended solutions. During chlorination, dilutions as low as 0.01% HFW altered the speciation toward formation of brominated and iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs) and brominated haloacetonitriles (HANs), and dilutions as low as 0.03% increased the overall formation of both compound classes. The increase in bromide concentration associated with 0.01–0.03% contribution of Marcellus HFW (a range of 70–200 μg/L for HFW with bromide = 600 mg/L) mimics the increased bromide levels observed in western Pennsylvanian surface waters following the Marcellus Shale gas production boom. Chloramination reduced HAN and regulated THM formation; however, iodinated trihalomethane formation was observed at lower pH. For municipal wastewater-impacted river water, the presence of 0.1% HFW increased the formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during chloramination, particularly for the high iodide (54 ppm) Fayetteville Shale HFW. Finally, ozonation of 0.01–0.03% HFW-impacted river water resulted in significant increases in bromate formation. The results suggest that total elimination of HFW discharge and/or installation of halide-specific removal techniques in centralized brine treatment facilities may be a better strategy to mitigate impacts on downstream drinking water treatment plants than altering disinfection strategies. The potential formation of multiple DBPs in drinking water utilities in areas of shale gas development requires comprehensive monitoring plans beyond the common regulated DBPs.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"19","pages":"11161-11169","date":"October 7, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In an effort to stop the discharge of Marcellus Shale unconventional natural gas development wastewaters into surface waters, on May 19, 2011 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) requested drilling companies stop disposing their wastewater through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This research includes a chemical analysis of effluents discharged from three WWTPs before and after the aforementioned request. The WWTPs sampled included two municipal, publicly owned treatment works and a commercially operated industrial wastewater treatment plant. Analyte concentrations were quanitified and then compared to water quality criteria, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency MCLs and “human health criteria.” Certain analytes including barium, strontium, bromides, chlorides, total dissolved solids, and benzene were measured in the effluent at concentrations above criteria. Analyte concentrations measured in effluent samples before and after the PADEP’s request were compared for each facility. Analyte concentrations in the effluents decreased in the majority of samples after the PADEP’s request (p < .05). This research provides preliminary evidence that these and similar WWTPs may not be able to provide sufficient treatment for this wastewater stream, and more thorough monitoring is recommended.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"7","pages":"3472-3481","date":"April 2, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Keranen et al. show that the steep rise in earthquakes in Oklahoma, USA, is likely caused by fluid migration from wastewater disposal wells. Twenty percent of the earthquakes in the central United States could be attributed to just four of the wells. Injected fluids in high-volume wells triggered earthquakes over 30 km away.\nScience, this issue p. 448\nUnconventional oil and gas production provides a rapidly growing energy source; however, high-production states in the United States, such as Oklahoma, face sharply rising numbers of earthquakes. Subsurface pressure data required to unequivocally link earthquakes to wastewater injection are rarely accessible. Here we use seismicity and hydrogeological models to show that fluid migration from high-rate disposal wells in Oklahoma is potentially responsible for the largest swarm. Earthquake hypocenters occur within disposal formations and upper basement, between 2- and 5-kilometer depth. The modeled fluid pressure perturbation propagates throughout the same depth range and tracks earthquakes to distances of 35 kilometers, with a triggering threshold of ~0.07 megapascals. Although thousands of disposal wells operate aseismically, four of the highest-rate wells are capable of inducing 20% of 2008 to 2013 central U.S. seismicity.\nThe recent surge in central U.S. seismicity is likely attributable to injection of wastewater at a small number of wells.\nThe recent surge in central U.S. seismicity is likely attributable to injection of wastewater at a small number of wells.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"345","issue":"6195","pages":"448-451","date":"2014/07/25","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1255802","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6195/448","accessDate":"2018-08-05T23:17:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 24993347","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T23:17:21Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T23:17:21Z"}},{"key":"VDH94BTX","version":3223,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VDH94BTX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VDH94BTX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Keranen et al.","parsedDate":"2013-06-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Keranen, Katie M., Heather M.

It has long been known that impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations are capable of inducing earthquakes. In particular, earthquakes caused by injection have become a focal point, as new drilling and well-completion technologies enable the extraction of oil and gas from previously unproductive formations.\n<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/341/6142/1225942/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>Earthquakes with magnitude (M) ≥ 3 in the U.S. midcontinent, 1967–2012. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011. Human-induced earthquakes are suspected to be partially responsible for the increase.\nAdvances Microearthquakes (that is, those with magnitudes below 2) are routinely produced as part of the hydraulic fracturing (or “fracking”) process used to stimulate the production of oil, but the process as currently practiced appears to pose a low risk of inducing destructive earthquakes. More than 100,000 wells have been subjected to fracking in recent years, and the largest induced earthquake was magnitude 3.6, which is too small to pose a serious risk. Yet, wastewater disposal by injection into deep wells poses a higher risk, because this practice can induce larger earthquakes. For example, several of the largest earthquakes in the U.S. midcontinent in 2011 and 2012 may have been triggered by nearby disposal wells. The largest of these was a magnitude 5.6 event in central Oklahoma that destroyed 14 homes and injured two people. The mechanism responsible for inducing these events appears to be the well-understood process of weakening a preexisting fault by elevating the fluid pressure. However, only a small fraction of the more than 30,000 wastewater disposal wells appears to be problematic—typically those that dispose of very large volumes of water and/or communicate pressure perturbations directly into basement faults.\nOutlook Injection-induced earthquakes, such as those that struck in 2011, clearly contribute to the seismic hazard. Quantifying their contribution presents difficult challenges that will require new research into the physics of induced earthquakes and the potential for inducing large-magnitude events. The petroleum industry needs clear requirements for operation, regulators must have a solid scientific basis for those requirements, and the public needs assurance that the regulations are sufficient and are being followed. The current regulatory frameworks for wastewater disposal wells were designed to protect potable water sources from contamination and do not address seismic safety. One consequence is that both the quantity and timeliness of information on injection volumes and pressures reported to regulatory agencies are far from ideal for managing earthquake risk from injection activities. In addition, seismic monitoring capabilities in many of the areas in which wastewater injection activities have increased are not capable of detecting small earthquake activity that may presage larger seismic events.\nMovers and Shakers\nWe tend to view earthquakes as unpredictable phenomena caused by naturally shifting stresses in Earth's crust. In reality, however, a range of human activity can also induce earthquakes. Ellsworth (p. 10.1126/science.1225942) reviews the current understanding of the causes and mechanics of earthquakes caused by human activity and the means to decrease their associated risk. Notable examples include injection of wastewater into deep formations and emerging technologies related to oil and gas recovery, including hydraulic fracturing. In addition to directly causing increased local seismic activity, activities such as deep fluid injection may have other ramifications related to earthquake occurrence. Van der Elst et al. (p. 164; see the news story by Kerr) demonstrate that in the midwestern United States, some areas with increased human-induced seismicity are also more prone to further earthquakes triggered by the seismic waves from large, remote earthquakes. Improved seismic monitoring and injection data near deep disposal sites will help to identify regions prone to remote triggering and, more broadly, suggest times when activities should, at least temporarily, be put on hold.\nEarthquakes in unusual locations have become an important topic of discussion in both North America and Europe, owing to the concern that industrial activity could cause damaging earthquakes. It has long been understood that earthquakes can be induced by impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations. Injection-induced earthquakes have, in particular, become a focus of discussion as the application of hydraulic fracturing to tight shale formations is enabling the production of oil and gas from previously unproductive formations. Earthquakes can be induced as part of the process to stimulate the production from tight shale formations, or by disposal of wastewater associated with stimulation and production. Here, I review recent seismic activity that may be associated with industrial activity, with a focus on the disposal of wastewater by injection in deep wells; assess the scientific understanding of induced earthquakes; and discuss the key scientific challenges to be met for assessing this hazard.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"341","issue":"6142","pages":"1225942","date":"2013/07/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1225942","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/1225942","accessDate":"2018-08-05T23:12:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 23846903","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T23:12:05Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T23:12:21Z"}},{"key":"HAYU8TTI","version":3208,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HAYU8TTI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HAYU8TTI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.

The U.S. Geological Survey National Seismic Hazard Model project uses probabilistic seismic hazard analysis to quantify the rate of exceedance for earthquake ground shaking (ground motion). For the 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model assessment, the seismic hazard from potentially induced earthquakes was intentionally not considered because we had not determined how to properly treat these earthquakes for the seismic hazard analysis. The phrases “potentially induced” and “induced” are used interchangeably in this report, however it is acknowledged that this classification is based on circumstantial evidence and scientific judgment. For the 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model update, the potentially induced earthquakes were removed from the NSHM’s earthquake catalog, and the documentation states that we would consider alternative models for including induced seismicity in a future version of the National Seismic Hazard Model. As part of the process of incorporating induced seismicity into the seismic hazard model, we evaluate the sensitivity of the seismic hazard from induced seismicity to five parts of the hazard model: (1) the earthquake catalog, (2) earthquake rates, (3) earthquake locations, (4) earthquake Mmax (maximum magnitude), and (5) earthquake ground motions. We describe alternative input models for each of the five parts that represent differences in scientific opinions on induced seismicity characteristics. In this report, however, we do not weight these input models to come up with a preferred final model. Instead, we present a sensitivity study showing uniform seismic hazard maps obtained by applying the alternative input models for induced seismicity. The final model will be released after further consideration of the reliability and scientific acceptability of each alternative input model. Forecasting the seismic hazard from induced earthquakes is fundamentally different from forecasting the seismic hazard for natural, tectonic earthquakes. This is because the spatio-temporal patterns of induced earthquakes are reliant on economic forces and public policy decisions regarding extraction and injection of fluids. As such, the rates of induced earthquakes are inherently variable and nonstationary. Therefore, we only make maps based on an annual rate of exceedance rather than the 50-year rates calculated for previous U.S. Geological Survey hazard maps.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Open File Report 2015-1070","institution":"","date":"2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2015/1070/","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:34:26Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T23:09:00Z"}},{"key":"SXNHEP3L","version":3204,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SXNHEP3L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SXNHEP3L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Atkinson et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Atkinson, Gail M., David W.

However, Bao and Eaton implicate hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) as the culprit in western Canada (see the Perspective by Elsworth). Fracking near Fox Creek, Alberta, reactivated faults, clustering earthquakes along the old fault traces. Fracking does not appear to cause large earthquakes in many other areas that are prone to induced seismicity. Understanding the underlying causes of seismicity in different localities is vital for developing sound regulation to limit damaging earthquakes.\nScience, this issue p. 1406; see also p. 1380\nHydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based earthquake catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (MW) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.\nHydraulic fracturing reactivated faults, inducing an earthquake of magnitude > 4 in western Canada.\nHydraulic fracturing reactivated faults, inducing an earthquake of magnitude > 4 in western Canada.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"354","issue":"6318","pages":"1406-1409","date":"2016/12/16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aag2583","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6318/1406","accessDate":"2018-08-05T23:06:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 27856850","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T23:06:56Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T23:06:56Z"}},{"key":"V5YIEMQG","version":3194,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/V5YIEMQG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/V5YIEMQG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Elst et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07-12","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Elst, Nicholas J. van der, Heather M.

Here, we demonstrate that areas with suspected anthropogenic earthquakes are also more susceptible to earthquake-triggering from natural transient stresses generated by the seismic waves of large remote earthquakes. Enhanced triggering susceptibility suggests the presence of critically loaded faults and potentially high fluid pressures. Sensitivity to remote triggering is most clearly seen in sites with a long delay between the start of injection and the onset of seismicity and in regions that went on to host moderate magnitude earthquakes within 6 to 20 months. Triggering in induced seismic zones could therefore be an indicator that fluid injection has brought the fault system to a critical state.\nWastewater injected deep underground can make some faults more susceptible to triggering by large remote earthquakes.\nWastewater injected deep underground can make some faults more susceptible to triggering by large remote earthquakes.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"2013/07/12","pages":"164-167","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/164","accessDate":"2018-08-05T23:06:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 23846900","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T23:06:22Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T23:06:40Z"}},{"key":"4ZJ8T555","version":3193,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4ZJ8T555","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4ZJ8T555","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hornbach et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hornbach, Matthew J., Madeline Jones, Monique Scales, Heather R.

The entire area of the field is of low topographic relief and provides no surface indications of underlying geological conditions. A study of the electric logs and cores of the oil wells provides subsurface information regarding the structure and the lithologic character of the sediments. The Wilmington structure is a large, broad, asymmetrical anticline having a northwest–southeast axial trend. The low angles of the dip of the unconsolidated beds near the crest, the presence of tension faulting, and the heavy overburden result in an unstable structure that is susceptible to compaction. Subsurface compaction resulting in surface subsidence has occurred in many oil-producing, fresh-water producing, and mining areas of the world. The chapter describes the techniques used to monitor subsidence. By controlling injection and production and monitoring surface elevation changes, subsidence is being effectively controlled.","bookTitle":"Developments in Petroleum Science","series":"Subsidence Due to Fluid Withdrawal","seriesNumber":"","volume":"41","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"","publisher":"Elsevier","date":"January 1, 1995","pages":"285-335","language":"","ISBN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376736106800531","accessDate":"2018-08-05T22:45:36Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.1016/S0376-7361(06)80053-1","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:45:36Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:45:36Z"}},{"key":"33M57SU3","version":3173,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/33M57SU3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/33M57SU3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hough and Page","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hough, Susan E., and Morgan T.

Growing evidence indicates that many of these events are induced, primarily by injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. The upsurge in activity has raised two questions: What is the background rate of tectonic earthquakes in Oklahoma? How much has the rate varied throughout historical and early instrumental times? In this article, we show that (1) seismicity rates since 2009 surpass previously observed rates throughout the twentieth century; (2) several lines of evidence suggest that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma during the twentieth century were likely induced by oil production activities, as they exhibit statistically significant temporal and spatial correspondence with disposal wells, and intensity measurements for the 1952 El Reno earthquake and possibly the 1956 Tulsa County earthquake follow the pattern observed in other induced earthquakes; and (3) there is evidence for a low level of tectonic seismicity in southeastern Oklahoma associated with the Ouachita structural belt. The 22 October 1882 Choctaw Nation earthquake, for which we estimate Mw 4.8, occurred in this zone.","publicationTitle":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","volume":"105","issue":"6","pages":"","date":"2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1785/0120150109","ISSN":"1943-3573","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159467","accessDate":"2018-08-05T22:38:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.er.usgs.gov","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"IP-063741","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:38:22Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:38:22Z"}},{"key":"MRCMFYXA","version":3173,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MRCMFYXA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MRCMFYXA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Petersen et al.","parsedDate":"2017-05-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Petersen, Mark D., Charles S.

This review evaluates risks to public health from chemical and nonchemical stressors associated with UNG, describes likely exposure pathways and potential health effects, and identifies major uncertainties to address with future research. The most important occupational stressors include mortality, exposure to hazardous materials and increased risk of industrial accidents. For communities near development and production sites the major stressors are air pollutants, ground and surface water contamination, truck traffic and noise pollution, accidents and malfunctions, and psychosocial stress associated with community change. Despite broad public concern, no comprehensive population-based studies of the public health effects of UNG operations exist. Major uncertainties are the unknown frequency and duration of human exposure, future extent of development, potential emission control and mitigation strategies, and a paucity of baseline data to enable substantive before and after comparisons for affected populations and environmental media. Overall, the current literature suggests that research needs to address these uncertainties before we can reasonably quantify the likelihood of occurrence or magnitude of adverse health effects associated with UNG production in workers and communities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8307-8320","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Empirical investigations have focused on the identification and measurement of oil and gas air pollutants [e.g. volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), methane] and the influence of UOG on local and regional ambient air quality (e.g. tropospheric ozone). While more studies to better characterize spatial and temporal trends in exposure among children and newborns near UOG sites are needed, existing research suggests that exposure to air pollutants emitted during lifecycle operations can potentially lead to adverse respiratory outcomes in this population. Children are known to be at a greater risk from exposure to air pollutants, which can impair lung function and neurodevelopment, or exacerbate existing conditions, such as asthma, because the respiratory system is particularly vulnerable during development in-utero, the postnatal period, and early childhood. In this article, we review the literature relevant to respiratory risks of UOG on infants and children. Existing epidemiology studies document the impact of air pollutant exposure on children in other contexts and suggest impacts near UOG. Research is sparse on long-term health risks associated with frequent acute exposures - especially in children - hence our interpretation of these findings may be conservative. Many data gaps remain, but existing data support precautionary measures to protect the health of infants and children.","publicationTitle":"Reviews on Environmental Health","volume":"31","issue":"2","pages":"225-243","date":"Jun 01, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rev Environ Health","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1515/reveh-2014-0070","ISSN":"2191-0308","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 27171386","tags":[{"tag":"Air Pollutants","type":1},{"tag":"Air Pollution","type":1},{"tag":"Child","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental Policy","type":1},{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Infant","type":1},{"tag":"Natural Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and Gas Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","type":1},{"tag":"Risk Assessment","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:32:10Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:32:10Z"}},{"key":"7P4IRNP2","version":3163,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7P4IRNP2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7P4IRNP2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Stacy et al.","parsedDate":"2015-06-03","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Stacy, Shaina L., LuAnn L.

Despite frequently expressed public concern, human health studies have not kept pace. We investigated the association of proximity to UGD in the Marcellus Shale formation and perinatal outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 15,451 live births in Southwest Pennsylvania from 2007–2010. Mothers were categorized into exposure quartiles based on inverse distance weighted (IDW) well count; least exposed mothers (first quartile) had an IDW well count less than 0.87 wells per mile, while the most exposed (fourth quartile) had 6.00 wells or greater per mile. Multivariate linear (birth weight) or logistical (small for gestational age (SGA) and prematurity) regression analyses, accounting for differences in maternal and child risk factors, were performed. There was no significant association of proximity and density of UGD with prematurity. Comparison of the most to least exposed, however, revealed lower birth weight (3323 ± 558 vs 3344 ± 544 g) and a higher incidence of SGA (6.5 vs 4.8%, respectively; odds ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.10–1.63). While the clinical significance of the differences in birth weight among the exposure groups is unclear, the present findings further emphasize the need for larger studies, in regio-specific fashion, with more precise characterization of exposure over an extended period of time to evaluate the potential public health significance of UGD.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"6","pages":"e0126425","date":"2015-6-3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0126425","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126425","accessDate":"2018-08-01T22:55:16Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Birth","type":1},{"tag":"Birth weight","type":1},{"tag":"Diabetes mellitus","type":1},{"tag":"Gestational diabetes","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Pregnancy","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Smoking habits","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BMRAG3Q5"},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:55:16Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:29:41Z"}},{"key":"AKUF5ND7","version":3162,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AKUF5ND7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AKUF5ND7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Webb et al.","parsedDate":"2017","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Webb, Ellen, Julie Moon, Larysa Dyrszka, Brian Rodriguez, Caroline Cox, Heather Patisaul, Sheila Bushkin, and Eric London. &#x201C;Neurodevelopmental and Neurological Effects of Chemicals Associated with Unconventional Oil and Natural Gas Operations and Their Potential Effects on Infants and Children.&#x201D; <i>Reviews on Environmental Health</i> 0, no. 0 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2017-0008.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"AKUF5ND7","version":3162,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Neurodevelopmental and neurological effects of chemicals associated with unconventional oil and natural gas operations and their potential effects on infants and children","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ellen","lastName":"Webb"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Moon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Larysa","lastName":"Dyrszka"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Rodriguez"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Caroline","lastName":"Cox"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Patisaul"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sheila","lastName":"Bushkin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric","lastName":"London"}],"abstractNote":"Heavy metals (arsenic and manganese), particulate matter (PM), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to significant neurodevelopmental health problems in infants, children and young adults. These substances are widely used in, or become byproducts of unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) development and operations. Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases. More research is needed to understand the extent of these concerns in the context of UOG, but since UOG development has expanded rapidly in recent years, the need for public health prevention techniques, well-designed studies and stronger state and national regulatory standards is becoming increasingly apparent.","publicationTitle":"Reviews on Environmental Health","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1515/reveh-2017-0008","ISSN":"0048-7554","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2017-0008/reveh-2017-0008.xml?format=INT","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:52:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DeGruyter","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"BTEX"},{"tag":"EDCs"},{"tag":"PAHs"},{"tag":"UOG"},{"tag":"children"},{"tag":"heavy metals"},{"tag":"particulate matter"}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HX736GP8"},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:29:22Z"}},{"key":"SSAW4W8J","version":3156,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SSAW4W8J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SSAW4W8J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Saberi","parsedDate":"2013-05-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Saberi, Poun&#xE9;. &#x201C;Navigating Medical Issues in Shale Territory&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; ,&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;  Navigating Medical Issues in Shale Territory.&#x201D; <i>NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy</i> 23, no. 1 (May 1, 2013): 209&#x2013;21. https://doi.org/10.2190/NS.23.1.m.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"SSAW4W8J","version":3156,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Navigating Medical Issues in Shale Territory                                                    ,                                                             Navigating Medical Issues in Shale Territory","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pouné","lastName":"Saberi"}],"abstractNote":"The introduction of natural gas drilling with high-volume hydraulic fracturing to Pennsylvania and neighboring states since 2004 has been accompanied by numerous reports of varied symptoms and illnesses by those living near these operations.

Response to public concern about potential adverse environmental and health impacts has led to the formation of state and national advisory committees., Objectives: We review the extent to which advisory committees formed in 2011 by President Obama and governors of the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania contain individuals with expertise pertinent to human environmental public health. We also analyze the extent to which human health issues are of concern to the public by reviewing presentations at the public meeting of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) Natural Gas Subcommittee formed by the U.S. President’s directive., Results: At a public hearing held by the SEAB Natural Gas Subcommittee 62.7% of those not in favor of drilling mentioned health issues. Although public health is specified to be a concern in the executive orders forming these three advisory committees, we could identify no individuals with health expertise among the 52 members of the Pennsylvania Governor’s Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, the Maryland Marcellus Shale Safe Drilling Initiative Advisory Commission, or the SEAB Natural Gas Subcommittee., Conclusions: Despite recognition of the environmental public health concerns related to drilling in the Marcellus Shale, neither state nor national advisory committees selected to respond to these concerns contained recognizable environmental public health expertise.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Health Perspectives","volume":"120","issue":"4","pages":"483-486","date":"2012-4","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ Health Perspect","language":"","DOI":"10.1289/ehp.1104594","ISSN":"0091-6765","shortTitle":"Missing from the Table","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339470/","accessDate":"2018-08-05T22:23:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 22233770\nPMCID: PMC3339470","tags":[],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:23:03Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:23:07Z"}},{"key":"PYECNBSS","version":3145,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PYECNBSS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PYECNBSS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bamberger and Oswald","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bamberger, Michelle, and Robert E.

In 2012, we published case reports of animals and humans affected by nearby drilling operations. Because of the potential for long-term effects of even low doses of environmental toxicants and the cumulative impact of exposures of multiple chemicals by multiple routes of exposure, a longitudinal study of these cases is necessary. Twenty-one cases from five states were followed longitudinally; the follow-up period averaged 25 months. In addition to humans, cases involved food animals, companion animals and wildlife. More than half of all exposures were related to drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations; these decreased slightly over time. More than a third of all exposures were associated with wastewater, processing and production operations; these exposures increased slightly over time. Health impacts decreased for families and animals moving from intensively drilled areas or remaining in areas where drilling activity decreased. In cases of families remaining in the same area and for which drilling activity either remained the same or increased, no change in health impacts was observed. Over the course of the study, the distribution of symptoms was unchanged for humans and companion animals, but in food animals, reproductive problems decreased and both respiratory and growth problems increased. This longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of obtaining detailed epidemiological data on the long-term health effects of multiple chemical exposures and multiple routes of exposure that are characteristic of the environmental impacts of unconventional drilling operations.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Science and Health.

Multiple gas production sources can be sited near residences. Health care providers evaluating patient health need to know the chemicals present, the emissions from different sites and the intensity and frequency of the exposures. This research describes a hypothetical case study designed to provide a basic model that demonstrates the direct effect of weather on exposure patterns of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). Because emissions from unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) sites are variable, a short term exposure profile is proposed that determines 6-hour assessments of emissions estimates, a time scale needed to assist physicians in the evaluation of individual exposures. The hypothetical case is based on observed conditions in shale gas development in Washington County, Pennsylvania, and on estimated emissions from facilities during gas development and production. An air exposure screening model was applied to determine the ambient concentration of VOCs and PM2.5 at different 6-hour periods of the day and night. Hourly wind speed, wind direction and cloud cover data from Pittsburgh International Airport were used to calculate the expected exposures. Fourteen months of daily observations were modeled. Higher than yearly average source terms were used to predict health impacts at periods when emissions are high. The frequency and intensity of exposures to PM2.5 and VOCs at a residence surrounded by three UNGD facilities was determined. The findings show that peak PM2.5 and VOC exposures occurred 83 times over the course of 14 months of well development. Among the stages of well development, the drilling, flaring and finishing, and gas production stages produced higher intensity exposures than the hydraulic fracturing stage. Over one year, compressor station emissions created 118 peak exposure levels and a gas processing plant produced 99 peak exposures over one year. The screening model identified the periods during the day and the specific weather conditions when the highest potential exposures would occur. The periodicity of occurrence of extreme exposures is similar to the episodic nature of the health complaints reported in Washington County and in the literature. This study demonstrates the need to determine the aggregate quantitative impact on health when multiple facilities are placed near residences, schools, daycare centers and other locations where people are present. It shows that understanding the influence of air stability and wind direction is essential to exposure assessment at the residential level. The model can be applied to other emissions and similar sites. Profiles such as this will assist health providers in understanding the frequency and intensity of the human exposures when diagnosing and treating patients living near unconventional natural gas development.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Science and Health.

Many studies present information on these concerns, yet the strength of epidemiological evidence remains tenuous. This paper is a review of the strength of evidence in scientific reporting of environmental hazards from UNGD activities associated with adverse human health outcomes. Studies were drawn from peer-reviewed and grey literature following a systematic search. Five databases were searched for studies published from January 1995 through March 2014 using key search terms relevant to environmental health. Studies were screened, ranked and then reviewed according to the strength of the evidence presented on adverse environmental health outcomes associated with UNGD. The initial searches yielded >1000 studies, but this was reduced to 109 relevant studies after the ranking process. Only seven studies were considered highly relevant based on strength of evidence. Articles spanned several relevant topics, but most focussed on impacts on typical environmental media, such as water and air, with much of the health impacts inferred rather than evidenced. Additionally, the majority of studies focussed on short-term, rather than long-term, health impacts, which is expected considering the timeframe of UNGD; therefore, very few studies examined health outcomes with longer latencies such as cancer or developmental outcomes. Current scientific evidence for UNGD that demonstrates associations between adverse health outcomes directly with environmental health hazards resulting from UNGD activities generally lacks methodological rigour. Importantly, however, there is also no evidence to rule out such health impacts. While the current evidence in the scientific research reporting leaves questions unanswered about the actual environmental health impacts, public health concerns remain intense. This is a clear gap in the scientific knowledge that requires urgent attention.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"505","issue":"","pages":"1127-1141","date":"February 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.084","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"Environmental health impacts of unconventional natural gas development","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714015290","accessDate":"2018-08-05T22:04:23Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Coal seam gas","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental health impact","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Strength of evidence","type":1},{"tag":"Tight gas","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:04:23Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:04:23Z"}},{"key":"4NUMUVC9","version":3124,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4NUMUVC9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4NUMUVC9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McKenzie et al.","parsedDate":"2017-02-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McKenzie, Lisa M., William B.

For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted (IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to estimate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with non-hematologic cancers. Findings Overall, ALL cases 0–24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count tertiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5–24, ALL cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1 to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035). Further adjustment for year of diagnosis increased the association. No association was found between ALL for children aged 0–4 years or NHL and IDW well counts. While our study benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population, use of cancer-controls, the limited number of ALL and NHL cases, and aggregation of ages into five year ranges, may have biased our associations toward the null. In addition, absence of information on O&G well activities, meteorology, and topography likely reduced temporal and spatial specificity in IDW well counts. Conclusion Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to known hematologic carcinogens, further study is clearly needed to substantiate both our positive and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on oil and gas development activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest (e.g. benzene) near homes, schools, and day care centers; provide age-specific residential histories; compare cases to controls without cancer; and address other potential confounders, and environmental stressors.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"e0170423","date":"2017-2-15","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170423","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170423","accessDate":"2018-08-05T22:02:36Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Benzene","type":1},{"tag":"Cancer detection and diagnosis","type":1},{"tag":"Colorado","type":1},{"tag":"Hematology","type":1},{"tag":"Leukemias","type":1},{"tag":"Lymphocytic leukemia","type":1},{"tag":"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma","type":1},{"tag":"Oils","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T22:02:36Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T22:02:36Z"}},{"key":"RNVTJ94G","version":3123,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RNVTJ94G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fryzek et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fryzek, Jon, Susan Pastula, Xiaohui Jiang, and David H.

A slightly elevated SIR was found for central nervous system tumors after drilling (SIR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25).

While large single earthquakes have documented mental health repercussions, health implications of these new, frequent earthquakes remain unknown. We aimed to examine associations between Oklahoma earthquakes and statewide anxiety measured by Google queries.\n        Methods: The U.S. Geologic Survey’s Advanced National Seismic System Comprehensive Catalog supplied earthquake dates and magnitudes. We used the Google Health application programming interface to compile the proportion of weekly Oklahoma-based health-related search episodes for anxiety. A quasi-experimental time-series analysis from January 2010 to May 2017 evaluated monthly counts of earthquakes ≥ magnitude 4 (a level felt by most people) in relation to anxiety, controlling for US-wide anxiety search episodes and Oklahoma-specific health-related queries.\n        Results: Oklahoma experienced an average of two (SD = 2) earthquakes ≥ magnitude 4 per month during the study period. For each additional earthquake ≥ magnitude 4, the proportion of Google search episodes for anxiety increased by 1.3% (95% confidence interval = 0.1%, 2.4%); 60% of this increase persisted for the following month. In months with 2 or more ≥ magnitude 4 earthquakes, the proportion of Google search episodes focused on anxiety increased by 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 2.3%, 9.3%). In a sub-analysis, Google search episodes for anxiety peaked about 3 weeks after ≥ magnitude 4 quakes.\n        Conclusions: These findings suggest that the recent increase in Oklahoma earthquakes has elicited a psychological response that may have implications for public health and regulatory policy.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Epidemiology","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"e016","date":"June 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en-US","DOI":"10.1097/EE9.0000000000000016","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2018/06000/Association_between_Oklahoma_earthquakes_and.8.aspx","accessDate":"2018-08-05T21:55:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.lww.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T21:55:26Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T21:56:21Z"}},{"key":"3MWQAB9W","version":3107,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3MWQAB9W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3MWQAB9W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Colorado Department of Health and Environment","parsedDate":"2017","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Colorado Department of Health and Environment. &#x201C;Assessment of Potential Public Health Effects from Oil and Gas Operations in Colorado.&#x201D; Denver, CO, 2017. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0tmPQ67k3NVVFc1TFg1eDhMMjQ/view.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3MWQAB9W","version":3107,"itemType":"report","title":"Assessment of Potential Public Health Effects from Oil and Gas Operations in Colorado","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Colorado Department of Health and Environment"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Denver, CO","institution":"","date":"2017","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0tmPQ67k3NVVFc1TFg1eDhMMjQ/view","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:02Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T21:54:34Z"}},{"key":"X5KUUXIS","version":3106,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5KUUXIS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5KUUXIS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fitzgerald and Mason","parsedDate":"2015-12-22","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fitzgerald, Timothy, and Charles F Mason. &#x201C;An Evaluation of the Toxicity of Hydraulic Fracturing Injectants,&#x201D; December 22, 2015, 40. https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2016/retrieve.php?pdfid=609.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X5KUUXIS","version":3106,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An Evaluation of the Toxicity of Hydraulic Fracturing Injectants","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Fitzgerald"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles F","lastName":"Mason"}],"abstractNote":"In the past 10–15 years, innovations in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have fueled a boom in the production of natural gas from geological formations that were previously unproﬁtable. The rapid deployment of fracking has been accompanied by concerns about negative externalities. In response, a regulatory regime has emerged that requires disclosure of chemical additives, but preserves a loophole by which ﬁrms can claim that such disclosure imperils “trade secrets.” To shed light on the importance of such a disclosure rule, we combine data from wells drilled in two signiﬁcant gas ﬁelds in Wyoming with disclosure data from FracFocus about injected chemicals and materials. We explore the relation between toxicity of injectants, tendency to use the trade secrets shield, and identity of the well operator and the service company that performed the frac job. Our results have implications for the impact on social net beneﬁts of the recently reported merger between two major service companies.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"40","date":"December 22, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2016/retrieve.php?pdfid=609","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:06:11Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T21:53:49Z"}},{"key":"4EMTNRDQ","version":3101,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4EMTNRDQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4EMTNRDQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kassotis et al.","parsedDate":"2016-07-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kassotis, Christopher D., John J.

The Marcellus play in the northeastern U.S.A. documents how fast this technology developed: the number of unconventional Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania (PA) increased from 8 in 2005 to ~7234 today. Publicly available databases in PA show only rare evidence of contamination of surface and groundwaters. This could document that incidents that impact PA waters have been relatively rare and that contaminants were quickly diluted. However, firm conclusions are hampered by i) the lack of information about location and timing of incidents; ii) the tendency to not release water quality data related to specific incidents due to liability or confidentiality agreements; iii) the sparseness of sample and sensor data for the analytes of interest; iv) the presence of pre-existing water impairments that make it difficult to determine potential impacts from shale-gas activity; and v) the fact that sensors can malfunction or drift. Although the monitoring data available to assess contamination events in PA are limited, the state manages an online database of violations. Overall, one fifth of gas wells drilled were given at least one non-administrative notice of violation (NOV) from the PA regulator. Through March 2013, 3.4% of gas wells were issued NOVs for well construction issues and 0.24% of gas wells received NOVs related to methane migration into groundwater. Between 2008 and 2012, 161 of the ~1000 complaints received by the state described contamination that implicated oil or gas activity: natural gas was reported for 56% and brine salt components for 14% of the properties. Six percent of the properties were impacted by sediments, turbidity, and/or drill cuttings. Most of the sites of groundwater contamination with methane and/or salt components were in previously glaciated northern PA where fracture flow sometimes allows long distance fluid transport. No cases of subsurface transport of fracking or flowback fluids into water supplies were documented. If Marcellus-related flowback/production waters did enter surface or groundwaters, the most likely contaminants to be detected would be Na, Ca, and Cl, but those elements are already common in natural waters. The most Marcellus-specific “fingerprint” elements are Sr, Ba, and Br. For example, variable Br concentrations measured in southwestern PA streams were attributed to permitted release of wastewaters from unconventional shale gas wells into PA streams through municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plants before 2011. Discharge has now been discontinued except for brines from a few plants still permitted to discharge conventional oil/gas brines after treatment. Overall, drinking water supply problems determined by the regulator to implicate oil/gas activities peaked in frequency in 2010 while spill rates increased through 2012. Although many minor violations and temporary problems have been reported, the picture that emerges from PA is that the fast shale-gas start may have led to relatively few environmental incidents of significant impact compared to wells drilled; however, the impacts remain difficult to assess due to the lack of transparent and accessible data.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Coal Geology","volume":"126","issue":"","pages":"140-156","date":"June 1, 2014","series":"Environmental geology and the unconventional gas revolution","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Coal Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.coal.2013.12.017","ISSN":"0166-5162","shortTitle":"Water resource impacts during unconventional shale gas development","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016651621300284X","accessDate":"2018-08-05T19:25:50Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental impact","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Hydrofracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Marcellus Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Water quality","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T19:25:50Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T19:25:50Z"}},{"key":"R9XGKMSZ","version":3095,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R9XGKMSZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R9XGKMSZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gallegos and Varela","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gallegos, Tanya J., and Brian A.

Comprehensive, published, and publicly available information regarding the extent, location, and character of hydraulic fracturing in the United States is scarce. This national spatial and temporal analysis of data on nearly 1 million hydraulically fractured wells and 1.8 million fracturing treatment records from 1947 through 2010 (aggregated in Data Series 868) is used to identify hydraulic fracturing trends in drilling methods and use of proppants, treatment fluids, additives, and water in the United States. These trends are compared to the literature in an effort to establish a common understanding of the differences in drilling methods, treatment fluids, and chemical additives and of how the newer technology has affected the water use volumes and areal distribution of hydraulic fracturing. Historically, Texas has had the highest number of records of hydraulic fracturing treatments and associated wells in the United States documented in the datasets described herein. Water-intensive horizontal/directional drilling has also increased from 6 percent of new hydraulically fractured wells drilled in the United States in 2000 to 42 percent of new wells drilled in 2010. Increases in horizontal drilling also coincided with the emergence of water-based “slick water” fracturing fluids. As such, the most current hydraulic fracturing materials and methods are notably different from those used in previous decades and have contributed to the development of previously inaccessible unconventional oil and gas production target areas, namely in shale and tight-sand reservoirs. Publicly available derivative datasets and locations developed from these analyses are described.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"Scientific Investigations Report","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"2015","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5131/","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T19:17:21Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T19:19:35Z"}},{"key":"IDJ4P4R2","version":3087,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IDJ4P4R2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IDJ4P4R2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jackson et al.","parsedDate":"2015-08-04","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jackson, Robert B., Ella R.

To our knowledge, however, no comprehensive analysis of hydraulic fracturing depths exists. Based on fracturing depths and water use for ∼44 000 wells reported between 2010 and 2013, the average fracturing depth across the United States was 8300 ft (∼2500 m). Many wells (6900; 16%) were fractured less than a mile from the surface, and 2600 wells (6%) were fractured above 3000 ft (900 m), particularly in Texas (850 wells), California (720), Arkansas (310), and Wyoming (300). Average water use per well nationally was 2 400 000 gallons (9 200 000 L), led by Arkansas (5 200 000 gallons), Louisiana (5 100 000 gallons), West Virginia (5 000 000 gallons), and Pennsylvania (4 500 000 gallons). Two thousand wells (∼5%) shallower than one mile and 350 wells (∼1%) shallower than 3000 ft were hydraulically fractured with >1 million gallons of water, particularly in Arkansas, New Mexico, Texas, Pennsylvania, and California. Because hydraulic fractures can propagate 2000 ft upward, shallow wells may warrant special safeguards, including a mandatory registry of locations, full chemical disclosure, and, where horizontal drilling is used, predrilling water testing to a radius 1000 ft beyond the greatest lateral extent.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"15","pages":"8969-8976","date":"August 4, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

It is generally assumed that high TDS comes from the mixing of surface water (injected fluid) with Na–Ca–Cl formation brines containing elevated Ba, but the mechanisms by which such mixing might occur are disputed. Here we show that Ba in water co-produced with gas could originate from water-rock reactions, with Ba levels observed in produced waters reached on a time scale relevant to hydraulic fracturing operations. We examined samples from three drill cores from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and New York to determine the possible water-rock reactions that release barium during hydraulic fracturing. Two samples, one containing microcrystalline barite (BaSO4) and one without barite, contain elevated concentrations of Ba relative to the crustal average for shale rocks. A third sample is slightly depleted in Ba relative to the crustal average. Micro-XRF measurements and SEM/EDS analysis combined with chemical sequential extraction methods reveal that a majority of the Ba in all samples (55–77 wt.%) is present in clays and can only be leached from the rock by dissolution in hydrofluoric acid. Thus, a majority of barium in our samples is relatively inaccessible to leaching under hydraulic fracturing conditions. However, the balance of Ba in the rocks is contained in phases that are potentially leachable during hydraulic fracturing (e.g., soluble salts, exchangeable sites on clays, carbonates, barite, organics). We next studied how shale reacts with water at elevated temperatures (80 °C), low Eh (−100 to −200 mV), and a range of ionic strengths (IS = 0.85–6.4) that emulate conditions prevalent at depth during hydraulic fracturing. Our experimental results indicate that the amount of Ba released from the bulk rock has a positive correlation with the ionic strength of the reacting fluid. Between 5 and 25% of the total Ba in the rock can be leached from shale under ionic strength conditions and leachate compositions typical of produced waters over a contact time of just 7 days. We suggest that reductive weathering of black shale occurs during hydraulic fracturing due to: 1) Ba2+ in clays exchanging with Na+ and Ca2+ ions that are present in high concentrations in produced water, and 2) increased solubility and dissolution kinetics of barite under high ionic strength conditions. At the low Eh conditions prevalent during hydraulic fracturing the sulfate deficient water allows Ba to be dissolved into the produced water. Based on Ba yields determined from laboratory leaching experiments of Marcellus Shale and a reasonable estimate of the water/rock mass ratio during hydraulic fracturing, we suggest that all of the Ba in produced water can be reconciled with leaching directly from the fractured rock.","publicationTitle":"Applied Geochemistry","volume":"65","issue":"","pages":"73-86","date":"February 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Geochemistry","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2015.11.001","ISSN":"0883-2927","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088329271530069X","accessDate":"2018-08-05T19:12:50Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Barite","type":1},{"tag":"Barium","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Marcellus Shale","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T19:12:50Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T19:12:50Z"}},{"key":"Q3L4M3VP","version":3080,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q3L4M3VP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q3L4M3VP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Anthony Ingraffea","parsedDate":"2013-01-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Here we assess all the reliable datasets (25) on well barrier and integrity failure in the published literature and online. These datasets include production, injection, idle and abandoned wells, both onshore and offshore, exploiting both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. The datasets vary considerably in terms of the number of wells examined, their age and their designs. Therefore the percentage of wells that have had some form of well barrier or integrity failure is highly variable (1.9%–75%). Of the 8030 wells targeting the Marcellus shale inspected in Pennsylvania between 2005 and 2013, 6.3% of these have been reported to the authorities for infringements related to well barrier or integrity failure. In a separate study of 3533 Pennsylvanian wells monitored between 2008 and 2011, there were 85 examples of cement or casing failures, 4 blowouts and 2 examples of gas venting. In the UK, 2152 hydrocarbon wells were drilled onshore between 1902 and 2013 mainly targeting conventional reservoirs. UK regulations, like those of other jurisdictions, include reclamation of the well site after well abandonment. As such, there is no visible evidence of 65.2% of these well sites on the land surface today and monitoring is not carried out. The ownership of up to 53% of wells in the UK is unclear; we estimate that between 50 and 100 are orphaned. Of 143 active UK wells that were producing at the end of 2000, one has evidence of a well integrity failure.","publicationTitle":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","volume":"56","issue":"","pages":"239-254","date":"September 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2014.03.001","ISSN":"0264-8172","shortTitle":"Oil and gas wells and their integrity","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817214000609","accessDate":"2018-08-05T19:00:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Barrier","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Integrity","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Wells","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-05T19:00:18Z","dateModified":"2018-08-05T19:00:18Z"}},{"key":"W6C7Y3Z9","version":3058,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/W6C7Y3Z9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/W6C7Y3Z9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Darrah et al.","parsedDate":"2014-09-30","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Darrah, Thomas H., Avner Vengosh, Robert B.

Identifying the sources and mechanisms of contamination can help improve the environmental and economic sustainability of shale-gas extraction. We analyzed 113 and 20 samples from drinking-water wells overlying the Marcellus and Barnett Shales, respectively, examining hydrocarbon abundance and isotopic compositions (e.g., C2H6/CH4, δ13C-CH4) and providing, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive analyses of noble gases and their isotopes (e.g., 4He, 20Ne, 36Ar) in groundwater near shale-gas wells. We addressed two questions. (i) Are elevated levels of hydrocarbon gases in drinking-water aquifers near gas wells natural or anthropogenic? (ii) If fugitive gas contamination exists, what mechanisms cause it? Against a backdrop of naturally occurring salt- and gas-rich groundwater, we identified eight discrete clusters of fugitive gas contamination, seven in Pennsylvania and one in Texas that showed increased contamination through time. Where fugitive gas contamination occurred, the relative proportions of thermogenic hydrocarbon gas (e.g., CH4, 4He) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) and the proportions of atmospheric gases (air-saturated water; e.g., N2, 36Ar) were significantly lower (P < 0.01) relative to background groundwater. Noble gas isotope and hydrocarbon data link four contamination clusters to gas leakage from intermediate-depth strata through failures of annulus cement, three to target production gases that seem to implicate faulty production casings, and one to an underground gas well failure. Noble gas data appear to rule out gas contamination by upward migration from depth through overlying geological strata triggered by horizontal drilling or hydraulic fracturing.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"111","issue":"39","pages":"14076-14081","date":"2014/09/30","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1322107111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/39/14076","accessDate":"2018-08-05T18:59:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH4 L-1 (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L-1 (P < 0.05; n = 34). Average δ13C-CH4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P < 0.0001). These δ13C-CH4 data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and δ2H-CH4 values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and—possibly—regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"108","issue":"20","pages":"8172-8176","date":"2011/05/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1100682108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/20/8172","accessDate":"2018-08-05T18:55:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

It can also serve as a transition fuel that will allow for the shift from coal to renewable energy resources while helping to reduce the emissions of CO2, criteria pollutants, and mercury by the power sector. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. The focus of this Review is on the current understanding of these environmental issues.\n<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/340/6134/1235009/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> Drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single well pad allows access to as much as 1 square mile of shale that is located more than a mile below. [Image courtesy of Range Resources Appalachia]\nAdvances The most common problem with well construction is a faulty seal that is emplaced to prevent gas migration into shallow groundwater. The incidence rate of seal problems in unconventional gas wells is relatively low (1 to 3%), but there is a substantial controversy whether the methane detected in private groundwater wells in the area where drilling for unconventional gas is ongoing was caused by well drilling or natural processes. It is difficult to resolve this issue because many areas have long had sources of methane unrelated to hydraulic fracturing, and pre-drilling baseline data are often unavailable. Water management for unconventional shale gas extraction is one of the key issues that will dominate environmental debate surrounding the gas industry. Reuse of produced water for hydraulic fracturing is currently addressing the concerns regarding the vast quantities of contaminants that are brought to the surface. As these well fields mature and the opportunities for wastewater reuse diminish, the need to find alternative management strategies for this wastewater will likely intensify.\nOutlook Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help effectively manage water-quality risks associated with unconventional gas industry today and in the future. Confidentiality requirements dictated by legal investigations combined with the expedited rate of development and the limited funding for research are major impediments to peer-reviewed research into environmental impacts. Now is the time to work on these environmental issues to avoid an adverse environmental legacy similar to that from abandoned coal mine discharges in Pennsylvania.\nFracturing Hydrology?\nHydraulic fracturing, widely known as \"fracking,\" is a relatively inexpensive way to tap into what were previously inaccessible natural gas resources. Vidic et al. (p. 826) review the current status of shale gas development and discuss the possible threats to water resources. In one of the hotbeds of fracking activity, the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States, there is little evidence that additives have directly entered groundwater supplies, but the risk remains. Ensuring access to monitoring data is an important first step toward addressing any public and environmental health concerns.\nUnconventional natural gas resources offer an opportunity to access a relatively clean fossil fuel that could potentially lead to energy independence for some countries. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. We review the current understanding of environmental issues associated with unconventional gas extraction. Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help manage these water-quality risks today and in the future.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"340","issue":"6134","pages":"1235009","date":"2013/05/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1235009","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/1235009","accessDate":"2018-08-04T13:54:29Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 23687049","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-04T13:54:29Z","dateModified":"2018-08-04T13:54:29Z"}},{"key":"5KYPEFYW","version":3046,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5KYPEFYW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5KYPEFYW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"U.

Specific pathways of contamination have been identified; however, overall rates of contamination remain ambiguous. We used an archive of geochemical data collected from 1988 to 2014 to determine the sources and occurrence of groundwater methane in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of northeastern Colorado. This 60,000-km2 region has a 60-y-long history of hydraulic fracturing, with horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing beginning in 2010. Of 924 sampled water wells in the basin, dissolved methane was detected in 593 wells at depths of 20–190 m. Based on carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes and gas molecular ratios, most of this methane was microbially generated, likely within shallow coal seams. A total of 42 water wells contained thermogenic stray gas originating from underlying oil and gas producing formations. Inadequate surface casing and leaks in production casing and wellhead seals in older, vertical oil and gas wells were identified as stray gas migration pathways. The rate of oil and gas wellbore failure was estimated as 0.06% of the 54,000 oil and gas wells in the basin (lower estimate) to 0.15% of the 20,700 wells in the area where stray gas contamination occurred (upper estimate) and has remained steady at about two cases per year since 2001. These results show that wellbore barrier failure, not high-volume hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells, is the main cause of thermogenic stray gas migration in this oil- and gas-producing basin.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"201523267","date":"2016/07/08","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1523267113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/07/05/1523267113","accessDate":"2018-08-03T20:09:08Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Concerns include the potential for migration of stray gas, metal-rich formation brines, and hydraulic fracturing and/or flowback fluids to drinking water aquifers. A critical question common to these environmental risks is the hydraulic connectivity between the shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers. We present geochemical evidence from northeastern Pennsylvania showing that pathways, unrelated to recent drilling activities, exist in some locations between deep underlying formations and shallow drinking water aquifers. Integration of chemical data (Br, Cl, Na, Ba, Sr, and Li) and isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 2H/H, 18O/16O, and 228Ra/226Ra) from this and previous studies in 426 shallow groundwater samples and 83 northern Appalachian brine samples suggest that mixing relationships between shallow ground water and a deep formation brine causes groundwater salinization in some locations. The strong geochemical fingerprint in the salinized (Cl > 20 mg/L) groundwater sampled from the Alluvium, Catskill, and Lock Haven aquifers suggests possible migration of Marcellus brine through naturally occurring pathways. The occurrences of saline water do not correlate with the location of shale-gas wells and are consistent with reported data before rapid shale-gas development in the region; however, the presence of these fluids suggests conductive pathways and specific geostructural and/or hydrodynamic regimes in northeastern Pennsylvania that are at increased risk for contamination of shallow drinking water resources, particularly by fugitive gases, because of natural hydraulic connections to deeper formations.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"109","issue":"30","pages":"11961-11966","date":"2012/07/24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1121181109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/11961","accessDate":"2018-08-03T20:08:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

An analysis of 75,505 compliance reports for 41,381 conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania drilled from January 1, 2000–December 31, 2012, was performed with the objective of determining complete and accurate statistics of casing and cement impairment. Statewide data show a sixfold higher incidence of cement and/or casing issues for shale gas wells relative to conventional wells. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate risk of impairment based on existing data. The model identified both temporal and geographic differences in risk. For post-2009 drilled wells, risk of a cement/casing impairment is 1.57-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) (1.45, 1.67); P < 0.0001] higher in an unconventional gas well relative to a conventional well drilled within the same time period. Temporal differences between well types were also observed and may reflect more thorough inspections and greater emphasis on finding well leaks, more detailed note taking in the available inspection reports, or real changes in rates of structural integrity loss due to rushed development or other unknown factors. Unconventional gas wells in northeastern (NE) Pennsylvania are at a 2.7-fold higher risk relative to the conventional wells in the same area. The predicted cumulative risk for all wells (unconventional and conventional) in the NE region is 8.5-fold [95% CI (7.16, 10.18); P < 0.0001] greater than that of wells drilled in the rest of the state.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"111","issue":"30","pages":"10955-10960","date":"2014/07/29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1323422111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/30/10955","accessDate":"2018-08-03T19:58:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

However, little attention has been paid to the potentialfor groundwater contamination resulting from surface spills from storage and production facilities at active well sites. We performed a search for publically available data regarding groundwater contamination from spills at ULS. drilling sites. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) database was selected for further analysis because it was the most detailed. The majority ofspills were in Weld County, Colorado, which has the highest density of wells that used hydraulic fracturing for completion, many producing both methane gas and crude oil. We analyzed publically available data reported by operators to the COGCC regarding surface spills that impacted groundwater From July 2010 to July 2011, we noted 77 reported surface spills impacting the groundwater in Weld County, which resulted in surface spills associated with less than 0.5% of the active wells. The reported data included groundwater samples that were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, andxylene (BTEX) components of crude oil. For groundwater samples taken both within the spill excavation area and on the first reported date of sampling, the BTEX measurements exceeded National Drinking Water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in 90, 30, 12, and 8% of the samples, respectively. However, actions taken to remediate the spills were effective at reducing BJTEX levels, with at least 84% of the spills reportedly achieving remediation as of May 2012. Our analysis demonstrates that surface spills are an important route of potential groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing activities and should be a focus of programs to protect groundwater\nIMPLICATIONS: While benzene can occur naturally in groundwater sources, spills and migration of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing activities have recently been thought to be a main source of benzene contamination in groundwater. However, there is little scientific literature to support that claim. Therefore, we accessed a publically available database and tracked the number of reported surface spills with potential groundwater impact over a 1-year period. Although the number of surface spills was minimal, our analysis provides scientific evidence that benzene can contaminate groundwater sources following surface spills at active well sites.","publicationTitle":"Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)","volume":"63","issue":"4","pages":"424-432","date":"Apr 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J Air Waste Manag Assoc","language":"eng","DOI":"","ISSN":"1096-2247","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23687727","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23687727","tags":[{"tag":"Benzene","type":1},{"tag":"Benzene Derivatives","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental Monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Industrial Waste","type":1},{"tag":"Toluene","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollutants, Chemical","type":1},{"tag":"Xylenes","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:09:36Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T19:58:04Z"}},{"key":"HNVFMBRQ","version":3028,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/HNVFMBRQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/HNVFMBRQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fontenot et al.","parsedDate":"2013-09-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fontenot, Brian E., Laura R.

Here, we present an assessment of private well water quality in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale formation of North Texas. We evaluated samples from 100 private drinking water wells using analytical chemistry techniques. Analyses revealed that arsenic, selenium, strontium and total dissolved solids (TDS) exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant Limit (MCL) in some samples from private water wells located within 3 km of active natural gas wells. Lower levels of arsenic, selenium, strontium, and barium were detected at reference sites outside the Barnett Shale region as well as sites within the Barnett Shale region located more than 3 km from active natural gas wells. Methanol and ethanol were also detected in 29% of samples. Samples exceeding MCL levels were randomly distributed within areas of active natural gas extraction, and the spatial patterns in our data suggest that elevated constituent levels could be due to a variety of factors including mobilization of natural constituents, hydrogeochemical changes from lowering of the water table, or industrial accidents such as faulty gas well casings.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"17","pages":"10032-10040","date":"Sep 03, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This paper provides a critical review of the potential risks that shale gas operations pose to water resources, with an emphasis on case studies mostly from the U.S. Four potential risks for water resources are identified: (1) the contamination of shallow aquifers with fugitive hydrocarbon gases (i.e., stray gas contamination), which can also potentially lead to the salinization of shallow groundwater through leaking natural gas wells and subsurface flow; (2) the contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and/or the disposal of inadequately treated shale gas wastewater; (3) the accumulation of toxic and radioactive elements in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) the overextraction of water resources for high-volume hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages or conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. Analysis of published data (through January 2014) reveals evidence for stray gas contamination, surface water impacts in areas of intensive shale gas development, and the accumulation of radium isotopes in some disposal and spill sites. The direct contamination of shallow groundwater from hydraulic fracturing fluids and deep formation waters by hydraulic fracturing itself, however, remains controversial.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8334-8348","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

One of these sources, the Marcellus Shale, located in the Allegheny Plateau, is undergoing extensive drilling and production. The technology used to extract gas in the Marcellus Shale is known as hydraulic fracturing and has garnered much attention because of its use of large amounts of fresh water, its use of proprietary fluids for the hydraulic-fracturing process, its potential to release contaminants into the environment, and its potential effect on water resources. Nonetheless, development of natural gas extraction wells in the Marcellus Shale is only part of the overall natural gas story in the area of Pennsylvania. Coalbed methane, which is sometimes extracted using the same technique, is often located in the same general area as the Marcellus Shale and is frequently developed in clusters across the landscape. The combined effects of these two natural gas extraction methods create potentially serious patterns of disturbance on the landscape. This document quantifies the landscape changes and consequences of natural gas extraction for Bradford County and Washington County, Pennsylvania, between 2004 and 2010. Patterns of landscape disturbance related to natural gas extraction activities were collected and digitized using National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery for 2004, 2005/2006, 2008, and 2010. The disturbance patterns were then used to measure changes in land cover and land use using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) of 2001. A series of landscape metrics is used to quantify these changes and are included in this publication.","reportNumber":"2012-1154","reportType":"USGS Numbered Series","seriesTitle":"Open-File Report","place":"Reston, VA","institution":"U.S. Geological Survey","date":"2012","pages":"41","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20121154","accessDate":"2018-08-03T19:10:08Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.er.usgs.gov","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T19:10:08Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T19:10:08Z"}},{"key":"TCN9YAR5","version":3008,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TCN9YAR5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TCN9YAR5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Adams et al.","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Adams, Mary Beth, W.

In DJ, Uintah, and FV, 72–83% of total measured emissions were from 20% of the well pads, while in UGR the highest 20% of emitting well pads only contributed 54% of total emissions. The total mass of methane emitted as a percent of gross methane produced, termed throughput-normalized methane average (TNMA) and determined by bootstrapping measurements from each basin, varied widely between basins and was (95% CI): 0.09% (0.05–0.15%) in FV, 0.18% (0.12–0.29%) in UGR, 2.1% (1.1–3.9%) in DJ, and 2.8% (1.0–8.6%) in Uintah. Overall, wet-gas basins (UGR, DJ, Uintah) had higher TNMA emissions than the dry-gas FV at all ranges of production per well pad. Among wet basins, TNMA emissions had a strong negative correlation with average gas production per well pad, suggesting that consolidation of operations onto single pads may reduce normalized emissions (average number of wells per pad is 5.3 in UGR versus 1.3 in Uintah and 2.8 in DJ).","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"15","pages":"8832-8840","date":"August 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) methods can be used to estimate potential emissions reductions through the use of such fuels. Some recent policies have used the results of LCAs to encourage the use of low carbon fuels to meet future energy demands in the U.S., without, however, acknowledging and addressing the uncertainty and variability prevalent in LCA. Natural gas is a particularly interesting fuel since it can be used to meet various energy demands, for example, as a transportation fuel or in power generation. Estimating the magnitudes and likelihoods of achieving emissions reductions from competing end-uses of natural gas using LCA offers one way to examine optimal strategies of natural gas resource allocation, given that its availability is likely to be limited in the future.  In this study, the uncertainty in life cycle GHG emissions of natural gas (domestic and imported) consumed in the U.S. was estimated using probabilistic modeling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain sample distributions representing life cycle GHG emissions from the use of 1 MJ of domestic natural gas and imported LNG. Life cycle GHG emissions per energy unit of average natural gas consumed in the U.S were found to range between -8 and 9% of the mean value of 66 g CO(2)e/MJ. The probabilities of achieving emissions reductions by using natural gas for transportation and power generation, as a substitute for incumbent fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and coal were estimated. The use of natural gas for power generation instead of coal was found to have the highest and most likely emissions reductions (almost a 100% probability of achieving reductions of 60 g CO(2)e/MJ of natural gas used), while there is a 10-35% probability of the emissions from natural gas being higher than the incumbent if it were used as a transportation fuel. This likelihood of an increase in GHG emissions is indicative of the potential failure of a climate policy targeting reductions in GHG emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"45","issue":"19","pages":"8182-8189","date":"Oct 01, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Unconventional energy generates income and, done well, can reduce air pollution and even water use compared with other fossil fuels. Alternatively, it could slow the adoption of renewables and, done poorly, release toxic chemicals into water and air. Primary threats to water resources include surface spills, wastewater disposal, and drinking-water contamination through poor well integrity. An increase in volatile organic compounds and air toxics locally are potential health threats, but the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation will reduce sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and particulate air pollution. Data gaps are particularly evident for human health studies, for the question of whether natural gas will displace coal compared with renewables, and for decadal-scale legacy issues of well leakage and plugging and abandonment practices. Critical topics for future research include data for (a) estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of unconventional hydrocarbons, (b) the potential for further reductions of water requirements and chemical toxicity, (c) whether unconventional resource development alters the frequency of well integrity failures, (d) potential contamination of surface and ground waters from drilling and spills, (e) factors that could cause wastewater injection to generate large earthquakes, and (f) the consequences of greenhouse gases and air pollution on ecosystems and human health.","publicationTitle":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","volume":"39","issue":"1","pages":"327-362","date":"October 17, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Annu.

We model the effect of different gas supplies on the US power sector and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Across a range of climate policies, we find that abundant natural gas decreases use of both coal and renewable energy technologies in the future. Without a climate policy, overall electricity use also increases as the gas supply increases. With reduced deployment of lower-carbon renewable energies and increased electricity consumption, the effect of higher gas supplies on GHG emissions is small: cumulative emissions 2013–55 in our high gas supply scenario are 2% less than in our low gas supply scenario, when there are no new climate policies and a methane leakage rate of 1.5% is assumed. Assuming leakage rates of 0 or 3% does not substantially alter this finding. In our results, only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future CO 2 emissions within the US electricity sector. Our results suggest that without strong limits on GHG emissions or policies that explicitly encourage renewable electricity, abundant natural gas may actually slow the process of decarbonization, primarily by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"9","issue":"9","pages":"094008","date":"2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Leveraging recently collected national emissions and activity data sets, we developed a new process-based emissions model implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation framework to estimate emissions for each component and facility in the system. We find that approximately 83% of emissions, given the existing suite of technologies, have the potential to be abated, with only a few emission categories comprising a majority of emissions. We then formulate optimization models to determine optimal abatement strategies. Most emissions across the system (approximately 80%) are efficient to abate, resulting in net benefits ranging from $160M to $1.2B annually across the system. The private cost burden is minimal under standard and tax instruments, and if firms market the abated natural gas, private net benefits may be generated. Superemitter policies, namely, those that target the highest emitting facilities, may reduce the private cost burden and achieve high emission reductions, especially if emissions across facilities are highly skewed. However, detection across all facilities is necessary regardless of the policy option and there are nontrivial net benefits resulting from abatement of relatively low-emitting sources.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"9","pages":"4772-4780","date":"May 2, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"353","issue":"6306","pages":"1416-1419","date":"2016/09/23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aag0262","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6306/1416","accessDate":"2018-08-03T18:48:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 27708035","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T18:48:18Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T18:48:18Z"}},{"key":"BYZXGM54","version":2968,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BYZXGM54","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BYZXGM54","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jeong et al.","parsedDate":"2014-05-20","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jeong, Seongeun, Dev Millstein, and Marc L.

Compared to official California bottom-up inventories, our initial estimates are 3 to 7 times higher for the petroleum and natural gas production sectors but similar for the natural gas transmission and distribution sectors. Evidence from published “top-down” atmospheric measurement campaigns within Southern California supports our initial emission estimates from production and processing but indicates emission estimates from transmission and distribution are low by a factor of approximately 2. To provide emission maps with more accurate total emissions we scale the spatially resolved inventory by sector-specific results from a Southern California aircraft measurement campaign to all of California. Assuming uncertainties are determined by the uncertainties estimated in the top-down study, our estimated state total CH4 emissions are 541 ± 144 Gg yr–1 (as compared with 210.7 Gg yr–1 in California’s current official inventory), where the majority of our reported uncertainty is derived from transmission and distribution. We note uncertainties relative to the mean for a given region are likely larger than that for the State total, emphasizing the need for additional measurements in undersampled regions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"10","pages":"5982-5990","date":"May 20, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Here we assess the level of GHG emissions from shale gas well hydraulic fracturing operations in the United States during 2010. Data from each of the approximately 4000 horizontal shale gas wells brought online that year are used to show that about 900 Gg CH 4 of potential fugitive emissions were generated by these operations, or 228 Mg CH 4 per well—a figure inappropriately used in analyses of the GHG impact of shale gas. In fact, along with simply venting gas produced during the completion of shale gas wells, two additional techniques are widely used to handle these potential emissions: gas flaring and reduced emission ‘green’ completions. The use of flaring and reduced emission completions reduce the levels of actual fugitive emissions from shale well completion operations to about 216 Gg CH 4 , or 50 Mg CH 4 per well, a release substantially lower than several widely quoted estimates. Although fugitive emissions from the overall natural gas sector are a proper concern, it is incorrect to suggest that shale gas-related hydraulic fracturing has substantially altered the overall GHG intensity of natural gas production.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"044030","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Using data from a global surface network and atmospheric column observations we show that the steady decline in the ethane mole fraction that began in the 1970s1,2,3 halted between 2005 and 2010 in most of the Northern Hemisphere and has since reversed. We calculate a yearly increase in ethane emissions in the Northern Hemisphere of 0.42 (±0.19) Tg yr−1 between mid-2009 and mid-2014. The largest increases in ethane and the shorter-lived propane are seen over the central and eastern USA, with a spatial distribution that suggests North American oil and natural gas development as the primary source of increasing emissions. By including other co-emitted oil and natural gas non-methane hydrocarbons, we estimate a Northern Hemisphere total non-methane hydrocarbon yearly emission increase of 1.2 (±0.8) Tg yr−1. Atmospheric chemical transport modelling suggests that these emissions could augment summertime mean surface ozone by several nanomoles per mole near oil and natural gas production regions. Methane/ethane oil and natural gas emission ratios could suggest a significant increase in associated methane emissions; however, this increase is inconsistent with observed leak rates in production regions and changes in methane’s global isotopic ratio.","publicationTitle":"Nature Geoscience","volume":"9","issue":"7","pages":"490-495","date":"2016-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/ngeo2721","ISSN":"1752-0908","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2721","accessDate":"2018-08-03T18:44:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2016 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T18:44:34Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T18:44:34Z"}},{"key":"VQ2XPHYD","version":2952,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VQ2XPHYD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VQ2XPHYD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zavala-Araiza et al.","parsedDate":"2015-12-22","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zavala-Araiza, Daniel, David R.

Based on data from a coordinated campaign in the Barnett Shale oil and gas-producing region of Texas, we find that top-down and bottom-up estimates of both total and fossil methane emissions agree within statistical confidence intervals (relative differences are 10% for fossil methane and 0.1% for total methane). We reduced uncertainty in top-down estimates by using repeated mass balance measurements, as well as ethane as a fingerprint for source attribution. Similarly, our bottom-up estimate incorporates a more complete count of facilities than past inventories, which omitted a significant number of major sources, and more effectively accounts for the influence of large emission sources using a statistical estimator that integrates observations from multiple ground-based measurement datasets. Two percent of oil and gas facilities in the Barnett accounts for half of methane emissions at any given time, and high-emitting facilities appear to be spatiotemporally variable. Measured oil and gas methane emissions are 90% larger than estimates based on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory and correspond to 1.5% of natural gas production. This rate of methane loss increases the 20-y climate impacts of natural gas consumed in the region by roughly 50%.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"51","pages":"15597-15602","date":"2015/12/22","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1522126112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/51/15597","accessDate":"2018-08-03T18:40:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Producing this NG requires the use of energy and water, and has varying environmental impacts, including greenhouse gases. One well-established tool for quantifying these impacts is life-cycle assessment (LCA). This study collected information from current operating companies to perform a process LCA of production for MS NG in three areas—greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, and water consumption—under both present (2011–2012) and past (2007–2010) operating practices. Energy return on investment (EROI) was also calculated. Information was collected from current well development operators and public databases, and combined with process LCA data to calculate per-well and per-MJ delivered impacts, and with literature data on combustion for calculation of impacts on a per-kWh basis during electricity generation. Results show that GHG emissions through combustion are similar to conventional natural gas, with an EROI of 12:1 (90% confidence interval of 4:1–13:1), lower than conventional fossil fuels but higher than unconventional oil sources.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"10","pages":"5459-5466","date":"May 21, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Referenced to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) CO emissions inventory, total CH4 emissions are 0.44 ± 0.15 Tg each year. To investigate the possible contribution of fossil fuel emissions, we use ambient air observations of methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), and carbon monoxide (CO), together with measured C2H6 to CH4 enhancement ratios in the Los Angeles natural gas supply. The observed atmospheric C2H6 to CH4 ratio during the ARCTAS (2008) and CalNex (2010) aircraft campaigns is similar to the ratio of these gases in the natural gas supplied to the basin during both these campaigns. Thus, at the upper limit (assuming that the only major source of atmospheric C2H6 is fugitive emissions from the natural gas infrastructure) these data are consistent with the attribution of most (0.39 ± 0.15 Tg yr–1) of the excess CH4 in the basin to uncombusted losses from the natural gas system (approximately 2.5–6% of natural gas delivered to basin customers). However, there are other sources of C2H6 in the region. In particular, emissions of C2H6 (and CH4) from natural gas seeps as well as those associated with petroleum production, both of which are poorly known, will reduce the inferred contribution of the natural gas infrastructure to the total CH4 emissions, potentially significantly. This study highlights both the value and challenges associated with the use of ethane as a tracer for fugitive emissions from the natural gas production and distribution system.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"46","issue":"17","pages":"9282-9289","date":"September 4, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Previous studies have estimated fugitive emissions rates (FER)—the fraction of produced NG (mainly methane and ethane) escaped to the atmosphere—between 1 and 9%. Most of these studies rely on few and outdated measurements, and some may represent only temporal/regional NG industry snapshots. This study estimates NG industry representative FER using global atmospheric methane and ethane measurements over three decades, and literature ranges of (i) tracer gas atmospheric lifetimes, (ii) non-NG source estimates, and (iii) fossil fuel fugitive gas hydrocarbon compositions. The modeling suggests an upper bound global average FER of 5% during 2006–2011, and a most likely FER of 2–4% since 2000, trending downward. These results do not account for highly uncertain natural hydrocarbon seepage, which could lower the FER. Further emissions reductions by the NG industry may be needed to ensure climate benefits over coal during the next few decades.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"14","pages":"7714-7722","date":"July 15, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

There is little publicly available data comparing unconventional and conventional gas production. Existing studies rely on national inventories, but it is not generally possible to separate emissions from unconventional and conventional sources within these totals. Even if unconventional and conventional sites had been listed separately, it would not be possible to eliminate site-specific factors to compare gas production methods on an equal footing. To address this difficulty, the emissions of gas production have instead been modeled. In this way, parameters common to both methods of production can be held constant, while allowing those parameters which differentiate unconventional gas and conventional gas production to vary. The results are placed into the context of power generation, to give a ″well-to-wire″ (WtW) intensity. It was estimated that shale gas typically has a WtW emissions intensity about 1.8–2.4% higher than conventional gas, arising mainly from higher methane releases in well completion. Even using extreme assumptions, it was found that WtW emissions from shale gas need be no more than 15% higher than conventional gas if flaring or recovery measures are used. In all cases considered, the WtW emissions of shale gas powergen are significantly lower than those of coal.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"45","issue":"24","pages":"10757-10764","date":"December 15, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

However, leaking natural gas causes climate damage because methane (CH4) has a high global warming potential. In this study, we use extreme-value theory to explore the distribution of natural gas leak sizes. By analyzing ∼15 000 measurements from 18 prior studies, we show that all available natural gas leakage data sets are statistically heavy-tailed, and that gas leaks are more extremely distributed than other natural and social phenomena. A unifying result is that the largest 5% of leaks typically contribute over 50% of the total leakage volume. While prior studies used log-normal model distributions, we show that log-normal functions poorly represent tail behavior. Our results suggest that published uncertainty ranges of CH4 emissions are too narrow, and that larger sample sizes are required in future studies to achieve targeted confidence intervals. Additionally, we find that cross-study aggregation of data sets to increase sample size is not recommended due to apparent deviation between sampled populations. Understanding the nature of leak distributions can improve emission estimates, better illustrate their uncertainty, allow prioritization of source categories, and improve sampling design. Also, these data can be used for more effective design of leak detection technologies.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"22","pages":"12512-12520","date":"November 15, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Total annual CH4 emissions of 2421 (+245/–237) Gg were estimated for all U.S. gathering and processing operations, which represents a CH4 loss rate of 0.47% (±0.05%) when normalized by 2012 CH4 production. Over 90% of those emissions were attributed to normal operation of gathering facilities (1697 +189/–185 Gg) and processing plants (506 +55/-52 Gg), with the balance attributed to gathering pipelines and processing plant routine maintenance and upsets. The median CH4 emissions estimate for processing plants is a factor of 1.7 lower than the 2012 EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimate, with the difference due largely to fewer reciprocating compressors, and a factor of 3.0 higher than that reported under the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Since gathering operations are currently embedded within the production segment of the EPA GHGI, direct comparison to our results is complicated. However, the study results suggest that CH4 emissions from gathering are substantially higher than the current EPA GHGI estimate and are equivalent to 30% of the total net CH4 emissions in the natural gas systems GHGI. Because CH4 emissions from most gathering facilities are not reported under the current rule and not all source categories are reported for processing plants, the total CH4 emissions from gathering and processing reported under the EPA GHGRP (180 Gg) represents only 14% of that tabulated in the EPA GHGI and 7% of that predicted from this study.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"17","pages":"10718-10727","date":"September 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Liquid unloadings clear wells of accumulated liquids to increase production, employing a variety of liquid lifting mechanisms. In this work, wells with and without plunger lifts were sampled. Most wells without plunger lifts unload less than 10 times per year with emissions averaging 21 000–35 000 scf methane (0.4–0.7 Mg) per event (95% confidence limits of 10 000–50 000 scf/event). For wells with plunger lifts, emissions averaged 1000–10 000 scf methane (0.02–0.2 Mg) per event (95% confidence limits of 500–12 000 scf/event). Some wells with plunger lifts are automatically triggered and unload thousands of times per year and these wells account for the majority of the emissions from all wells with liquid unloadings. If the data collected in this work are assumed to be representative of national populations, the data suggest that the central estimate of emissions from unloadings (270 Gg/yr, 95% confidence range of 190–400 Gg) are within a few percent of the emissions estimated in the EPA 2012 Greenhouse Gas National Emission Inventory (released in 2014), with emissions dominated by wells with high frequencies of unloadings.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"1","pages":"641-648","date":"January 6, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, compared with the ethane-to-methane ratio in the pipeline gas delivered to the region, demonstrate that natural gas accounted for ∼60–100% of methane emissions, depending on season. Using government statistics and geospatial data on natural gas use, we find the average fractional loss rate to the atmosphere from all downstream components of the natural gas system, including transmission, distribution, and end use, was 2.7 ± 0.6% in the Boston urban region, with little seasonal variability. This fraction is notably higher than the 1.1% implied by the most closely comparable emission inventory.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"7","pages":"1941-1946","date":"2015/02/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1416261112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/7/1941","accessDate":"2018-08-03T17:56:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Excluding the two superemitters, study-average methane emissions from compressor housings and noncompressor sources are comparable to or lower than the corresponding effective emission factors used in the EPA greenhouse gas inventory. If the two superemitters are included in the analysis, then the average emission factors based on this study could exceed the EPA greenhouse gas inventory emission factors, which highlights the potentially important contribution of superemitters to national emissions. However, quantification of their influence requires knowledge of the magnitude and frequency of superemitters across the entire T&S sector. Only 38% of the methane emissions measured by the comprehensive onsite measurements were reportable under the new EPA GHGRP because of a combination of inaccurate emission factors for leakers and exhaust methane, and various exclusions. The bias is even larger if one accounts for the superemitters, which were not captured by the onsite measurements. The magnitude of the bias varied from site to site by site type and operating state. Therefore, while the GHGRP is a valuable new source of emissions information, care must be taken when incorporating these data into emission inventories. The value of the GHGRP can be increased by requiring more direct measurements of emissions (as opposed to using counts and emission factors), eliminating exclusions such as rod-packing vents on pressurized reciprocating compressors in standby mode under Subpart-W, and using more appropriate emission factors for exhaust methane from reciprocating engines under Subpart-C.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"5","pages":"3252-3261","date":"March 3, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In this study, we measured facility-level CH4 emissions rates from the NG production sector in the Marcellus region, and compared CH4 emissions between unconventional NG (UNG) well pad sites and the relatively smaller and older “conventional” NG (CvNG) sites that consist of wells drilled vertically into permeable geologic formations. A top-down tracer-flux CH4 measurement approach utilizing mobile downwind intercepts of CH4, ethane, and tracer (nitrous oxide and acetylene) plumes was performed at 18 CvNG sites (19 individual wells) and 17 UNG sites (88 individual wells). The 17 UNG sites included four sites undergoing completion flowback (FB). The mean facility-level CH4 emission rate among UNG well pad sites in routine production (18.8 kg/h (95% confidence interval (CI) on the mean of 12.0—26.8 kg/h)) was 23 times greater than the mean CH4 emissions from CvNG sites. These differences were attributed, in part, to the large size (based on number of wells and ancillary NG production equipment) and the significantly higher production rate of UNG sites. However, CvNG sites generally had much higher production-normalized CH4 emission rates (median: 11%; range: 0.35—91%) compared to UNG sites (median: 0.13%, range: 0.01—1.2%), likely resulting from a greater prevalence of avoidable process operating conditions (e.g., unresolved equipment maintenance issues). At the regional scale, we estimate that total annual CH4 emissions from 88 500 combined CvNG well pads in Pennsylvania and West Virginia (660 Gg (95% CI: 500 to 800 Gg)) exceeded that from 3390 UNG well pads by 170 Gg, reflecting the large number of CvNG wells and the comparably large fraction of CH4 lost per unit production. The new emissions data suggest that the recently instituted Pennsylvania CH4 emissions inventory substantially underestimates measured facility-level CH4 emissions by >10—40 times for five UNG sites in this study.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"4","pages":"2099-2107","date":"February 16, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

It has been debated whether the fugitive methane emissions during natural gas production and transmission outweigh the lower carbon dioxide emissions during combustion when compared to coal and petroleum. Using the current state of knowledge of methane emissions from shale gas, conventional natural gas, coal, and petroleum, we estimated up-to-date life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we developed distribution functions for key parameters in each pathway to examine uncertainty and identify data gaps such as methane emissions from shale gas well completions and conventional natural gas liquid unloadings that need to be further addressed. Our base case results show that shale gas life-cycle emissions are 6% lower than conventional natural gas, 23% lower than gasoline, and 33% lower than coal. However, the range in values for shale and conventional gas overlap, so there is a statistical uncertainty whether shale gas emissions are indeed lower than conventional gas. Moreover, this life-cycle analysis, among other work in this area, provides insight on critical stages that the natural gas industry and government agencies can work together on to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"46","issue":"2","pages":"619-627","date":"January 17, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

We estimate that the development and completion of a typical Marcellus shale well results in roughly 5500 t of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions or about1.8 g CO 2 e/MJ of gas produced, assuming conservative estimates of the production lifetime of a typical well. This represents an 11% increase in GHG emissions relative to average domestic gas (excluding combustion) and a 3% increase relative to the life cycle emissions when combustion is included. The life cycle GHG emissions of Marcellus shale natural gas are estimated to be63–75 g CO 2 e/MJ of gas produced with an average of 68 g CO 2 e/MJ of gas produced. Marcellus shale natural gas GHG emissions are comparable to those of imported liquefied natural gas. Natural gas from the Marcellus shale has generally lower life cycle GHG emissions than coal for production of electricity in the absence of any effective carbon capture and storage processes, by 20–50% depending upon plant efficiencies and natural gas emissions variability. There is significant uncertainty in our Marcellus shale GHG emission estimates due to eventual production volumes and variability in flaring, construction and transportation.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"6","issue":"3","pages":"034014","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

We find that exported U.S. LNG has mean precombustion emissions of 37 g CO2-equiv/MJ when regasified in Europe and Asia. Shipping emissions of LNG exported from U.S. ports to Asian and European markets account for only 3.5−5.5% of precombustion life cycle emissions, hence shipping distance is not a major driver of GHGs. A scenario-based analysis addressing how potential end uses (electricity and industrial heating) and displacement of existing fuels (coal and Russian natural gas) affect GHG emissions shows the mean emissions for electricity generation using U.S. exported LNG were 655 g CO2-equiv/kWh (with a 90% confidence interval of 562–770), an 11% increase over U.S. natural gas electricity generation. Mean emissions from industrial heating were 104 g CO2-equiv/MJ (90% CI: 87–123). By displacing coal, LNG saves 550 g CO2-equiv per kWh of electricity and 20 g per MJ of heat. LNG saves GHGs under upstream fugitive emissions rates up to 9% and 5% for electricity and heating, respectively. GHG reductions were found if Russian pipeline natural gas was displaced for electricity and heating use regardless of GWP, as long as U.S. fugitive emission rates remain below the estimated 5–7% rate of Russian gas. However, from a country specific carbon accounting perspective, there is an imbalance in accrued social costs and benefits. Assuming a mean social cost of carbon of $49/metric ton, mean global savings from U.S. LNG displacement of coal for electricity generation are $1.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gaseous natural gas exported as LNG ($.028/kWh). Conversely, the U.S. carbon cost of exporting the LNG is $1.80/Mcf ($.013/kWh), or $0.50-$5.50/Mcf across the range of potential discount rates. This spatial shift in embodied carbon emissions is important to consider in national interest estimates for LNG exports.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"5","pages":"3237-3245","date":"March 3, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The data sources and approach used in this study differ significantly from previous efforts. The authors used inventories from the year 2009 tracking emissions of regulated air pollutants by the natural gas industry in the Barnett Shale play. These inventories were collected and screened by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). These data cover the characteristics and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of more than 16,000 individual sources in shale gas production and processing. Translating estimated emissions of VOCs into estimates of methane and carbon dioxide emissions was accomplished through the novel compilation of spatially heterogeneous gas composition analyses. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generated from Barnett Shale gas extracted in 2009 were found to be very similar to conventional natural gas and less than half those of coal-fired electricity generation.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Unconventional Oil and Gas Resources","volume":"8","issue":"","pages":"46-55","date":"December 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Unconventional Oil and Gas Resources","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.juogr.2014.07.002","ISSN":"2213-3976","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213397614000366","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:56:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment (LCA)","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Power: methane leakage","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T16:56:45Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T16:56:45Z"}},{"key":"NNZ9UG2Z","version":2882,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NNZ9UG2Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NNZ9UG2Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber and Clavin","parsedDate":"2012-06-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weber, Christopher L., and Christopher Clavin. &#x201C;Life Cycle Carbon Footprint of Shale Gas: Review of Evidence and Implications.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 46, no. 11 (June 5, 2012): 5688&#x2013;95. https://doi.org/10.1021/es300375n.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"NNZ9UG2Z","version":2882,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Life Cycle Carbon Footprint of Shale Gas: Review of Evidence and Implications","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher L.","lastName":"Weber"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Clavin"}],"abstractNote":"The recent increase in the production of natural gas from shale deposits has significantly changed energy outlooks in both the US and world. Shale gas may have important climate benefits if it displaces more carbon-intensive oil or coal, but recent attention has discussed the potential for upstream methane emissions to counteract this reduced combustion greenhouse gas emissions. We examine six recent studies to produce a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis of the carbon footprint of both shale and conventional natural gas production. The results show that the most likely upstream carbon footprints of these types of natural gas production are largely similar, with overlapping 95% uncertainty ranges of 11.0–21.0 g CO2e/MJLHV for shale gas and 12.4–19.5 g CO2e/MJLHV for conventional gas. However, because this upstream footprint represents less than 25% of the total carbon footprint of gas, the efficiency of producing heat, electricity, transportation services, or other function is of equal or greater importance when identifying emission reduction opportunities. Better data are needed to reduce the uncertainty in natural gas’s carbon footprint, but understanding system-level climate impacts of shale gas, through shifts in national and global energy markets, may be more important and requires more detailed energy and economic systems assessments.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"46","issue":"11","pages":"5688-5695","date":"June 5, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

An econometric model, tuned to data reported for regional generation of US electricity, is used to diagnose factors responsible for the 2009 decrease. More than half of the reduction is attributed to a shift from generation of power using coal to gas driven by a recent decrease in gas prices in response to the increase in production from shale. An important result of the model is that, when the cost differential for generation using gas rather than coal falls below 2–3 cents/kWh, less efficient coal fired plants are displaced by more efficient natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generation alternatives. Costs for generation using NGCC decreased by close to 4 cents/kWh in 2009 relative to 2008 ensuring that generation of electricity using gas was competitive with coal in 2009 in contrast to the situation in 2008 when gas prices were much higher. A modest price on carbon could contribute to additional switching from coal to gas with further savings in CO2 emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"46","issue":"5","pages":"3014-3021","date":"March 6, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

However, identifying high emitters remains a challenge. We couple 163 well measurements of methane flow rates; ethane, propane, and n-butane concentrations; isotopes of methane; and noble gas concentrations from 88 wells in Pennsylvania with synthesized data from historical documents, field investigations, and state databases. Using our databases, we (i) improve estimates of the number of abandoned wells in Pennsylvania; (ii) characterize key attributes that accompany high emitters, including depth, type, plugging status, and coal area designation; and (iii) estimate attribute-specific and overall methane emissions from abandoned wells. High emitters are best predicted as unplugged gas wells and plugged/vented gas wells in coal areas and appear to be unrelated to the presence of underground natural gas storage areas or unconventional oil/gas production. Repeat measurements over 2 years show that flow rates of high emitters are sustained through time. Our attribute-based methane emission data and our comprehensive estimate of 470,000–750,000 abandoned wells in Pennsylvania result in estimated state-wide emissions of 0.04–0.07 Mt (1012 g) CH4 per year. This estimate represents 5–8% of annual anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. Our methodology combining new field measurements with data mining of previously unavailable well attributes and numbers of wells can be used to improve methane emission estimates and prioritize cost-effective mitigation strategies for Pennsylvania and beyond.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"48","pages":"13636-13641","date":"2016/11/29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1605913113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/13636","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:50:27Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

However, there has also been confusion about the climate implications of increased use of natural gas for electric power and transportation. We propose and illustrate the use of technology warming potentials as a robust and transparent way to compare the cumulative radiative forcing created by alternative technologies fueled by natural gas and oil or coal by using the best available estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from each fuel cycle (i.e., production, transportation and use). We find that a shift to compressed natural gas vehicles from gasoline or diesel vehicles leads to greater radiative forcing of the climate for 80 or 280 yr, respectively, before beginning to produce benefits. Compressed natural gas vehicles could produce climate benefits on all time frames if the well-to-wheels CH4 leakage were capped at a level 45–70% below current estimates. By contrast, using natural gas instead of coal for electric power plants can reduce radiative forcing immediately, and reducing CH4 losses from the production and transportation of natural gas would produce even greater benefits. There is a need for the natural gas industry and science community to help obtain better emissions data and for increased efforts to reduce methane leakage in order to minimize the climate footprint of natural gas.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"109","issue":"17","pages":"6435-6440","date":"2012/04/24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1202407109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/17/6435","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:45:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Crude oil and gas production in Eagle Ford has steadily increased since 2010. By the summer of 2015, oil and gas production reached 1.59 million barrels (bbl) per day and 7.14 billion cubic feet, respectively. This study summarizes liquids and gas production in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas from 2010 through 2013 and calculates energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the crude oil and NG extraction using the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator (OPGEE) model. OPGEE is an engineering-based life cycle assessment tool for estimating GHG emissions from the production, processing, and transport of crude petroleum. The system boundary of OPGEE extends from initial exploration to the refinery entrance gate. The operational energy consumption and flaring/fugitive emission intensities that are modeled by OPGEE provide the key inputs for the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model developed at Argonne National Laboratory for modeling the life-cycle GHG emissions of crude oil and NG production in the Eagle Ford shale.\nThe Eagle Ford can be characterized by four distinct production zones—the black oil (BO), volatile oil (VO), condensate (C), and gas (Gas) zones—with average monthly gas-to-liquid ratios (million cubic feet /bbl/month/well) that vary from 0.91 in the BO zone to 13.9 in the Gas zone. We found that the recovery energy efficiency, process fuel consumption, flaring and fugitive intensities, and water use showed little variation over time between 2010 and 2013. Wide variations in energy use and production among the thousands of wells were observed. In the BO zone, on an energy basis, about 20% of the NG produced is either flared (12%), emitted (1.5%), or used for self-consumption (5.7%), and 81% is sent to the market as pipeline NG and natural gas liquids (NGL). In comparison, only about 2% of the NG produced in the Gas zone is either flared (0.1%), emitted (0.01%), or used for self-consumption (2.4%), and 98% is sent to the market as pipeline NG and NGL. The proportion of NG sent to the market is about 45–49% as NG and 51–55% as NGL (on an energy basis). Process fuel consumption rate, flaring and fugitive intensities, and water use rate are in general higher in the Gas and C zones than in the BO and VO zones. The total MMBtu of energy (including diesel, NG, and electricity) used for production, extraction, and surface processing per MMBtu energy produced (including liquids, net NG sale, and net NGL sale) ranges from 0.012 MMBtu/MMBtu in the BO zone to 0.024 MMBtu/MMBtu in the Gas zone, with an average of 0.015 MMBtu/MMBtu across all wells. The well-to-wheels GHG emissions of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel derived from crude oil produced in the BO and VO zones in the Eagle Ford play are 89.2, 87.8, and 82.5 gCO2e/MJ, respectively.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"September 1, 2015","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"Energy Intensity and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Crude Oil Production in the Eagle Ford Region","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ResearchGate","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T14:54:30Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T16:33:31Z"}},{"key":"YHCBZZRB","version":2853,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YHCBZZRB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YHCBZZRB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brandt","parsedDate":"2015-11-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brandt, Adam R. &#x201C;Embodied Energy and GHG Emissions from Material Use in Conventional and Unconventional Oil and Gas Operations.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 49, no. 21 (November 3, 2015): 13059&#x2013;66. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b03540.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"YHCBZZRB","version":2853,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Embodied Energy and GHG Emissions from Material Use in Conventional and Unconventional Oil and Gas Operations","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adam R.","lastName":"Brandt"}],"abstractNote":"Environmental impacts embodied in oilfield capital equipment have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present the first open-source model which computes the embodied energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with materials consumed in constructing oil and gas wells and associated infrastructure. The model includes well casing, wellbore cement, drilling mud, processing equipment, gas compression, and transport infrastructure. Default case results show that consumption of materials in constructing oilfield equipment consumes ∼0.014 MJ of primary energy per MJ of oil produced, and results in ∼1.3 gCO2-eq GHG emissions per MJ (lower heating value) of crude oil produced, an increase of 15% relative to upstream emissions assessed in earlier OPGEE model versions, and an increase of 1–1.5% of full life cycle emissions. A case study of a hydraulically fractured well in the Bakken formation of North Dakota suggests lower energy intensity (0.011 MJ/MJ) and emissions intensity (1.03 gCO2-eq/MJ) due to the high productivity of hydraulically fractured wells. Results are sensitive to per-well productivity, the complexity of wellbore casing design, and the energy and emissions intensity per kg of material consumed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"21","pages":"13059-13066","date":"November 3, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Here, we report on a national sampling program to measure methane emissions from 13 urban distribution systems across the U.S. Emission factors were derived from direct measurements at 230 underground pipeline leaks and 229 metering and regulating facilities using stratified random sampling. When these new emission factors are combined with estimates for customer meters, maintenance, and upsets, and current pipeline miles and numbers of facilities, the total estimate is 393 Gg/yr with a 95% upper confidence limit of 854 Gg/yr (0.10% to 0.22% of the methane delivered nationwide). This fraction includes emissions from city gates to the customer meter, but does not include other urban sources or those downstream of customer meters. The upper confidence limit accounts for the skewed distribution of measurements, where a few large emitters accounted for most of the emissions. This emission estimate is 36% to 70% less than the 2011 EPA inventory, (based largely on 1990s emission data), and reflects significant upgrades at metering and regulating stations, improvements in leak detection and maintenance activities, as well as potential effects from differences in methodologies between the two studies.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"8","pages":"5161-5169","date":"April 21, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Estimates also suggest that NG supply will increasingly come from imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). Additional supplies of NG could come domestically from the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) via coal gasification−methanation. The objective of this study is to compare greenhouse gas (GHG), SOx, and NOx life-cycle emissions of electricity generated with NG/LNG/SNG and coal. This life-cycle comparison of air emissions from different fuels can help us better understand the advantages and disadvantages of using coal versus globally sourced NG for electricity generation. Our estimates suggest that with the current fleet of power plants, a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have lower GHG emissions than coal. If advanced technologies with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are used, however, coal and a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have very similar life-cycle GHG emissions. For SOx and NOx we find there are significant emissions in the upstream stages of the NG/LNG life-cycles, which contribute to a larger range in SOx and NOx emissions for NG/LNG than for coal and SNG.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"41","issue":"17","pages":"6290-6296","date":"September 1, 2007","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Data for three sites were compared: a site in the geographical center of the natural gas production region (Eagle Mountain Lake (EML)); a rural/suburban site at the periphery of the production region (Flower Mound Shiloh), and an urban site (Hinton). The dominant hydrocarbon species observed in the Barnett Shale region were light alkanes. Analyses of daily, monthly, and hourly patterns showed little variation in relative composition. Observed concentrations were compared to concentrations predicted using a dispersion model (AERMOD) and a spatially resolved inventory of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from natural gas production (Barnett Shale Special Emissions Inventory) prepared by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), and other emissions information. The predicted concentrations of VOC due to natural gas production were 0–40% lower than background corrected measurements, after accounting for potential under-estimation of certain emission categories. Hourly and daily variations in observed, background corrected concentrations were primarily explained by variability in meteorology, suggesting that episodic emission events had little impact on hourly averaged concentrations. Total emissions for VOC from natural gas production sources are estimated to be approximately 25 300 tons/yr, when accounting for potential under-estimation of certain emission categories. This region produced, in 2011, approximately 5 bcf/d of natural gas (100 Gg/d) for a VOC to natural gas production ratio (mass basis) of 0.0006.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"9","pages":"5314-5321","date":"May 6, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Emission rates were log-normally distributed with geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 0.33 (0.23, 0.48), 0.14 (0.11, 0.19), and 0.59 (0.47, 0.74) g/s in the Barnett, Denver-Julesburg, and Pinedale basins, respectively. This study focused on sites with emission rates above 0.01 g/s and included short-term (i.e., condensate tank flashing) and maintenance-related emissions. The results fell within the upper ranges of the distributions observed in recent onsite direct measurement studies. Considering data across all basins, a multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship of methane emissions to well age, gas production, and hydrocarbon liquids (oil or condensate) production. Methane emissions were positively correlated with gas production, but only approximately 10% of the variation in emission rates was explained by variation in production levels. The weak correlation between emission and production rates may indicate that maintenance-related stochastic variables and design of production and control equipment are factors determining emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"24","pages":"14508-14515","date":"December 16, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Therefore, we measured CH4 and CO2 emissions at three NGPPs and three refineries using an aircraft-based mass balance technique. Average CH4 emission rates (NGPPs: 140 ± 70 kg/h; refineries: 580 ± 220 kg/h, 95% CL) were larger than facility-reported estimates by factors of 21–120 (NGPPs) and 11–90 (refineries). At NGPPs, the percentage of unburned CH4 emitted from stacks (0.01–0.14%) was much lower than respective facility-scale losses (0.10–0.42%), and CH4 emissions from both NGPPs and refineries were more strongly correlated with enhanced H2O concentrations (R2avg = 0.65) than with CO2 (R2avg = 0.21), suggesting noncombustion-related equipment as potential CH4 sources. Additionally, calculated throughput-based emission factors (EF) derived from the NGPP measurements made in this study were, on average, a factor of 4.4 (stacks) and 42 (facility-scale) larger than industry-used EFs. Subsequently, throughput-based EFs for both the NGPPs and refineries were used to estimate total U.S. emissions from these facility-types. Results indicate that NGPPs and oil refineries may be large sources of CH4 emissions and could contribute significantly (0.61 ± 0.18 Tg CH4/yr, 95% CL) to U.S. emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"6","pages":"3373-3381","date":"March 21, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Using a mass balance approach on eight different flight days in March and October 2013, the total CH4 emissions for the region are estimated to be 76 ± 13 × 103 kg hr–1 (equivalent to 0.66 ± 0.11 Tg CH4 yr–1; 95% confidence interval (CI)). We estimate that 60 ± 11 × 103 kg CH4 hr–1 (95% CI) are emitted by natural gas and oil operations, including production, processing, and distribution in the urban areas of Dallas and Fort Worth. This estimate agrees with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimate for nationwide CH4 emissions from the natural gas sector when scaled by natural gas production, but it is higher than emissions reported by the EDGAR inventory or by industry to EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This study is the first to show consistency between mass balance results on so many different days and in two different seasons, enabling better quantification of the related uncertainty. The Barnett is one of the largest production basins in the United States, with 8% of total U.S. natural gas production, and thus, our results represent a crucial step toward determining the greenhouse gas footprint of U.S. onshore natural gas production.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8124-8131","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In turn, these emissions may be missing from most bottom-up emission inventories. We performed helicopter-based infrared camera surveys of more than 8000 O&G well pads in seven U.S. basins to assess the prevalence and distribution of high-emitting hydrocarbon sources (detection threshold ∼ 1–3 g s–1). The proportion of sites with such high-emitting sources was 4% nationally but ranged from 1% in the Powder River (Wyoming) to 14% in the Bakken (North Dakota). Emissions were observed three times more frequently at sites in the oil-producing Bakken and oil-producing regions of mixed basins (p < 0.0001, χ2 test). However, statistical models using basin and well pad characteristics explained 14% or less of the variance in observed emission patterns, indicating that stochastic processes dominate the occurrence of high emissions at individual sites. Over 90% of almost 500 detected sources were from tank vents and hatches. Although tank emissions may be partially attributable to flash gas, observed frequencies in most basins exceed those expected if emissions were effectively captured and controlled, demonstrating that tank emission control systems commonly underperform. Tanks represent a key mitigation opportunity for reducing methane and VOC emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"9","pages":"4877-4886","date":"May 3, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Specifically, we focus on water management and greenhouse gas emission implications. If unconventional natural gas in the United States is produced responsibly, transported and distributed with little leakage, and incorporated into integrated energy systems that are designed for future resiliency, it could play a significant role in realizing a more sustainable energy future. The cutting-edge of industry water management practices gives a picture of how this transition is unfolding, although much opportunity remains to minimize water use and related environmental impacts. The role of natural gas to mitigate climate forcing is less clear. While natural gas has low CO2 emissions upon direct use, methane leakage and long term climate effects lead to the conclusion that increased use of natural gas as a substitute for more carbon intensive fuels will not substantially alter world carbon dioxide concentration projections, and that other zero or low carbon energy sources will be needed to limit GHG concentrations. We conclude with some possible avenues for further work.","publicationTitle":"MRS Energy & Sustainability","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2015/ed","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1557/mre.2015.5","ISSN":"2329-2229, 2329-2237","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-energy-and-sustainability/article/a-review-of-water-and-greenhouse-gas-impacts-of-unconventional-natural-gas-development-in-the-united-states/B6A519061D37BE56D1EF2D593379301C","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:16:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge Core","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"natural gas and environmental impacts","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas in energy scenarios","type":1},{"tag":"unconventional natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"unconventional natural gas and water","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T16:16:18Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T16:16:18Z"}},{"key":"2Z5HHXFT","version":2801,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2Z5HHXFT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2Z5HHXFT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pétron et al.","parsedDate":"2014-06-16","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">P&#xE9;tron, Gabrielle, Anna Karion, Colm Sweeney, Benjamin R.

Total top-down CH4 emission estimates are 25.8 ± 8.4 and 26.2 ± 10.7 t CH4/h for the 29 and 31 May flights, respectively. Using inventory data, we estimate the total emissions of CH4 from non-O&G gas-related sources at 7.1 ± 1.7 and 6.3 ± 1.0 t CH4/h for these 2 days. The difference in emissions is attributed to O&G sources in the study region, and their total emission is on average 19.3 ± 6.9 t/h, close to 3 times higher than an hourly emission estimate based on Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data for 2012. We derive top-down emissions estimates for propane, n-butane, i-pentane, n-pentane, and benzene from our total top-down CH4 emission estimate and the relative hydrocarbon abundances in aircraft-based discrete air samples. Emissions for these five nonmethane hydrocarbons alone total 25.4 ± 8.2 t/h. Assuming that these emissions are solely originating from O&G-related activities in the study region, our results show that the state inventory for total volatile organic compounds emitted by O&G activities is at least a factor of 2 too low for May 2012. Our top-down emission estimate of benzene emissions from O&G operations is 173 ± 64 kg/h, or 7 times larger than in the state inventory.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"119","issue":"11","pages":"6836-6852","date":"2014-06-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2013JD021272","ISSN":"2169-8996","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013JD021272","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:09:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2014.

These points are not in dispute. However, in their recent publication in Climatic Change Letters, Howarth et al. (2011) report that their life-cycle evaluation of shale gas drilling suggests that shale gas has a larger GHG footprint than coal and that this larger footprint “undercuts the logic of its use as a bridging fuel over the coming decades”. We argue here that their analysis is seriously flawed in that they significantly overestimate the fugitive emissions associated with unconventional gas extraction, undervalue the contribution of “green technologies” to reducing those emissions to a level approaching that of conventional gas, base their comparison between gas and coal on heat rather than electricity generation (almost the sole use of coal), and assume a time interval over which to compute the relative climate impact of gas compared to coal that does not capture the contrast between the long residence time of CO2 and the short residence time of methane in the atmosphere. High leakage rates, a short methane GWP, and comparison in terms of heat content are the inappropriate bases upon which Howarth et al. ground their claim that gas could be twice as bad as coal in its greenhouse impact. Using more reasonable leakage rates and bases of comparison, shale gas has a GHG footprint that is half and perhaps a third that of coal.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"113","issue":"2","pages":"525-535","date":"2012/07/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0333-0","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0333-0","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:08:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T16:08:00Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T16:08:00Z"}},{"key":"IQEPWMME","version":2788,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IQEPWMME","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IQEPWMME","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Howarth","parsedDate":"2014-06-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Howarth, Robert W. &#x201C;A Bridge to Nowhere: Methane Emissions and the Greenhouse Gas Footprint of Natural Gas.&#x201D; <i>Energy Science &amp; Engineering</i> 2, no. 2 (June 1, 2014): 47&#x2013;60. https://doi.org/10.1002/ese3.35.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IQEPWMME","version":2788,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A bridge to nowhere: methane emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Howarth"}],"abstractNote":"In April 2011, we published the first peer-reviewed analysis of the greenhouse gas footprint (GHG) of shale gas, concluding that the climate impact of shale gas may be worse than that of other fossil fuels such as coal and oil because of methane emissions. We noted the poor quality of publicly available data to support our analysis and called for further research. Our paper spurred a large increase in research and analysis, including several new studies that have better measured methane emissions from natural gas systems. Here, I review this new research in the context of our 2011 paper and the fifth assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released in 2013. The best data available now indicate that our estimates of methane emission from both shale gas and conventional natural gas were relatively robust. Using these new, best available data and a 20-year time period for comparing the warming potential of methane to carbon dioxide, the conclusion stands that both shale gas and conventional natural gas have a larger GHG than do coal or oil, for any possible use of natural gas and particularly for the primary uses of residential and commercial heating. The 20-year time period is appropriate because of the urgent need to reduce methane emissions over the coming 15–35 years.","publicationTitle":"Energy Science & Engineering","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"47-60","date":"2014-06-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/ese3.35","ISSN":"2050-0505","shortTitle":"A bridge to nowhere","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ese3.35","accessDate":"2018-08-03T16:07:12Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2014 The Author.

The VOC compositions in the vicinity of individual gas and oil wells and other point sources such as evaporation ponds, compressor stations and injection wells are compared to the measurements at Horse Pool. High mixing ratios of aromatics, alkanes, cycloalkanes and methanol were observed for extended periods of time and for short-term spikes caused by local point sources. The mixing ratios during the time the mobile laboratory spent on the well pads were averaged. High mixing ratios were found close to all point sources, but gas well pads with collection and dehydration on the well pad were clearly associated with higher mixing ratios than other wells. The comparison of the VOC composition of the emissions from the oil and natural gas well pads showed that gas well pads without dehydration on the well pad compared well with the majority of the data at Horse Pool, and that oil well pads compared well with the rest of the ground site data. Oil well pads on average emit heavier compounds than gas well pads. The mobile laboratory measurements confirm the results from an emissions inventory: the main VOC source categories from individual point sources are dehydrators, oil and condensate tank flashing and pneumatic devices and pumps. Raw natural gas is emitted from the pneumatic devices and pumps and heavier VOC mixes from the tank flashings.</p>","publicationTitle":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","volume":"14","issue":"20","pages":"10977-10988","date":"2014/10/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"English","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-10977-2014","ISSN":"1680-7316","shortTitle":"Volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and natural gas industry in the Uintah Basin, Utah","url":"https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/10977/2014/","accessDate":"2018-08-03T13:53:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.atmos-chem-phys.net","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T13:53:33Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T13:53:33Z"}},{"key":"A4LUKLIV","version":2779,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/A4LUKLIV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/A4LUKLIV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Martin et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Martin, Randal, Kori Moore, Marc Mansfield, Scott Hill, Kiera Harper, and Howard Shorthill. &#x201C;Uinta Basin Winter Ozone and Air Quality Study.&#x201D; Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation.

Region-wide estimated damages ranged from $7.2 to $32 million dollars for 2011. The emissions from Pennsylvania shale gas extraction represented only a few per cent of total statewide emissions, and the resulting statewide damages were less than those estimated for each of the state’s largest coal-based power plants. On the other hand, in counties where activities are concentrated, NO x emissions from all shale gas activities were 20–40 times higher than allowable for a single minor source, despite the fact that individual new gas industry facilities generally fall below the major source threshold for NO x . Most emissions are related to ongoing activities, i.e., gas production and compression, which can be expected to persist beyond initial development and which are largely unrelated to the unconventional nature of the resource. Regulatory agencies and the shale gas industry, in developing regulations and best practices, should consider air emissions from these long-term activities, especially if development occurs in more populated areas of the state where per-ton emissions damages are significantly higher.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"014017","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Most indoor exposure occurs by diffusion of soil gas. Radon is also found in well water, natural gas, and ambient air. Pennsylvania has high indoor radon concentrations; buildings are often tested during real estate transactions, with results reported to the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP).\nOBJECTIVES: We evaluated predictors of indoor radon concentrations.\nMETHODS: Using first-floor and basement indoor radon results reported to the PADEP between 1987 and 2013, we evaluated associations of radon concentrations (natural log transformed) with geology, water source, building characteristics, season, weather, community socioeconomic status, community type, and unconventional natural gas development measures based on drilled and producing wells.\nRESULTS: Primary analysis included 866,735 first measurements by building, with the large majority from homes. The geologic rock layer on which the building sat was strongly associated with radon concentration (e.g., Axemann Formation, median = 365 Bq/m3, IQR = 167-679 vs. Stockton Formation, median = 93 Bq/m3, IQR = 52-178). In adjusted analysis, buildings using well water had 21% higher concentrations (β = 0.191, 95% CI: 0.184, 0.198). Buildings in cities (vs. townships) had lower concentrations (β = -0.323, 95% CI: -0.333, -0.314). When we included multiple tests per building, concentrations declined with repeated measurements over time. Between 2005 and 2013, 7,469 unconventional wells were drilled in Pennsylvania. Basement radon concentrations fluctuated between 1987 and 2003, but began an upward trend from 2004 to 2012 in all county categories (p < 0.001), with higher levels in counties having ≥ 100 drilled wells versus counties with none, and with highest levels in the Reading Prong.\nCONCLUSIONS: Geologic unit, well water, community, weather, and unconventional natural gas development were associated with indoor radon concentrations. Future studies should include direct environmental measurement of radon, as well as building features unavailable for this analysis.\nCITATION: Casey JA, Ogburn EL, Rasmussen SG, Irving JK, Pollak J, Locke PA, Schwartz BS. 2015.

However, the environmental impacts associated with fracking for shale gas have made it controversial. This review examines emissions and impacts of air pollutants associated with shale gas production and use. Emissions and impacts of greenhouse gases, photochemically active air pollutants, and toxic air pollutants are described. In addition to the direct atmospheric impacts of expanded natural gas production, indirect effects are also described. Widespread availability of shale gas can drive down natural gas prices, which, in turn, can impact the use patterns for natural gas. Natural gas production and use in electricity generation are used as a case study for examining these indirect consequences of expanded natural gas availability.","publicationTitle":"Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","volume":"5","issue":"1","pages":"55-75","date":"2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060713-035938","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060713-035938","accessDate":"2018-08-03T13:41:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Annual Reviews","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 24498952","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T13:41:13Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T13:41:13Z"}},{"key":"LJ4YQAZ4","version":2758,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/LJ4YQAZ4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/LJ4YQAZ4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Moore et al.","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Moore, Christopher W., Barbara Zielinska, Gabrielle P&#xE9;tron, and Robert B.

Here, we summarize the current understanding of local and regional air quality impacts of natural gas extraction, production, and use. Air emissions from the natural gas life cycle include greenhouse gases, ozone precursors (volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides), air toxics, and particulates. National and state regulators primarily use generic emission inventories to assess the climate, air quality, and health impacts of natural gas systems. These inventories rely on limited, incomplete, and sometimes outdated emission factors and activity data, based on few measurements. We discuss case studies for specific air impacts grouped by natural gas life cycle segment, summarize the potential benefits of using natural gas over other fossil fuels, and examine national and state emission regulations pertaining to natural gas systems. Finally, we highlight specific gaps in scientific knowledge and suggest that substantial additional measurements of air emissions from the natural gas life cycle are essential to understanding the impacts and benefits of this resource.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8349-8359","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The purpose of the sampling was to measure air emissions that may\nbe associated with the well completion activities.\nThe air sampling results are consistent with what would be expected. Concentrations of likely\noil and gas related compounds such as ethane and propane were found to be slightly higher at the\nErie sites than in downtown Denver, but much lower than in Platteville where greater oil and gas\nactivity is taking place. Similarly, methane levels at the Erie sites were consistent with other\nlocations, and were higher than in Denver, and lower than in Platteville. Toluene and benzene\nlevels were higher at one Erie monitor than the other, likely due to emissions from truck traffic.\nThe monitored concentrations of benzene, one of the major risk driving chemicals, are well\nwithin acceptable limits to protect public health, as determined by the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency. The concentrations of various compounds are comparatively low and are not\nlikely to raise significant health issues of concern. However, it should be noted the current state\nof the science is unable to estimate the potential risks due to exposure from multiple chemicals at\nthe same time, which may be higher.\nNatural gas is composed primarily of “alkanes” such as methane, ethane and propane, with\nmethane comprising up to 90% of the gas. Alkanes are generally considered to have a low\npotential for adverse health effects. Methane is a greenhouse gas that can contribute to\nenvironmental impacts. Volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas development,\nalong with emissions from other industrial activities and vehicles, can contribute to ground level\nozone formation.\nThis study provides a snapshot in time for this natural gas completion activity at this well pad\nonly. The completion activities at this well pad were done using reduced emission or “green”\ncompletion techniques, which are a “best management” requirement designed to minimize air\nemissions from well completions. No significant concentrations were recorded that could be\ndirectly attributed to well completion operations at this well pad. This study includes a limited\ndata set and may or may not be representative of conditions and potential emissions at other\nlocations.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"December 5, 2012","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.colorado.gov/airquality/tech_doc_repository.aspx?action=open&file=Erie+Air+Emissions+Case+Study+2012+-+revised+11252014.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:03Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T13:01:26Z"}},{"key":"EFW37QET","version":2753,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EFW37QET","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EFW37QET","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Al Armendariz","parsedDate":"2009-01-26","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Al Armendariz. &#x201C;Emissions from Natural Gas Production in the Barnett Shale Area and Opportunities for Cost-Effective Improvements,&#x201D; January 26, 2009. https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/9235_Barnett_Shale_Report.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"EFW37QET","version":2753,"itemType":"report","title":"Emissions from Natural Gas Production in the Barnett Shale Area and Opportunities for Cost-Effective Improvements","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Al Armendariz"}],"abstractNote":"Natural gas production in the Barnett Shale region of Texas has increased rapidly since 1999, and as of\nJune 2008, over 7700 oil and gas wells had been installed and another 4700 wells were pending. Gas\nproduction in 2007 was approximately 923 Bcf from wells in 21 counties. Natural gas is a critical\nfeedstock to many chemical production processes, and it has many environmental benefits over coal as a\nfuel for electricity generation, including lower emissions of sulfur, metal compounds, and carbon dioxide.\nNevertheless, oil and gas production from the Barnett Shale area can impact local air quality and release\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The objectives of this study were to develop an emissions\ninventory of air pollutants from oil and gas production in the Barnett Shale area, and to identify costeffective\nemissions control options.\nEmission sources from the oil and gas sector in the Barnett Shale area were divided into point sources,\nwhich included compressor engine exhausts and oil/condensate tanks, as well as fugitive and intermittent\nsources, which included production equipment fugitives, well drilling and fracing engines, well\ncompletions, gas processing, and transmission fugitives. The air pollutants considered in this inventory\nwere smog-forming compounds (NOx and VOC), greenhouse gases, and air toxic chemicals.\nFor 2009, emissions of smog-forming compounds from compressor engine exhausts and tanks were\npredicted to be approximately 96 tons per day (tpd) on an annual average, with peak summer emissions of\n212 tpd. Emissions during the summer increase because of the effects of temperature on volatile organic\ncompound emissions from storage tanks. Emissions of smog-forming compounds in 2009 from all oil and\ngas sources were estimated to be approximately 191 tpd on an annual average, with peak summer\nemissions of 307 tpd. The portion of those emissions originating from the 5-counties in the D-FW\nmetropolitan area with significant oil and gas production was 165 tpd during the summer.\nFor comparison, 2009 emission inventories recently used by state and federal regulators estimated smogforming\nemissions from all airports in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area to be 16 tpd. In addition,\nthese same inventories had emission estimates for on-road motor vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.) in the 9-\ncounty Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area of 273 tpd. The portion of on-road motor vehicle emissions\nfrom the 5-counties in the D-FW metropolitan area with significant oil and gas production was 121 tpd,\nindicating that the oil and gas sector likely has greater emissions than motor vehicles in these counties.\nThe emission rate of air toxic compounds (like benzene and formaldehyde) from Barnett Shale activities\nwas predicted to be approximately 6 tpd on an annual average, and 17 tpd during peak summer days. The\nlargest contributors to air toxic emissions were the condensate tanks, followed by the engine exhausts.\nIn addition, predicted 2009 emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane were\napproximately 33,000 tons per day of CO2 equivalent. This is roughly equivalent to the expected\ngreenhouse gas impact from two 750 MW coal-fired power plants. The largest contributors to the Barnett\nShale greenhouse gas impact were CO2 emissions from compressor engine exhausts and fugitive CH4\nemissions from all source types.\nCost effective control strategies are readily available that can substantially reduce emissions, and in some\ncases, reduce costs for oil and gas operators. These options include:\nx use of \"green completions\" to capture methane and VOC compounds during well completions,\nx phasing in electric motors as an alternative to internal-combustion engines to drive compressors,\nx the control of VOC emissions from condensate tanks with vapor recovery units, and\nx replacement of high-bleed pneumatic valves and fittings on the pipeline networks with no-bleed\nalternatives.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"January 26, 2009","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/9235_Barnett_Shale_Report.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-03T12:46:56Z","dateModified":"2018-08-03T12:50:43Z"}},{"key":"CVUC2XQA","version":2744,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CVUC2XQA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CVUC2XQA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Casey et al.","parsedDate":"2018-07-27","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Casey, Joan A., Holly C.

We evaluated the association of unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) with depression symptoms and disordered sleep diagnoses using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and electronic health record data among Geisinger adult primary care patients in Pennsylvania. Participants received a retrospective metric for UNGD at their residence (very low, low, medium, and high) that incorporated dates and durations of well development, distance from patient homes to wells, and well characteristics. Analyses included 4,762 participants with no (62%), mild (23%), moderate (10%), and moderately severe or severe (5%) depression symptoms in 2014–2015 and 3,868 disordered sleep diagnoses between 2009–2015. We observed associations between living closer to more and bigger wells and depression symptoms, but not disordered sleep diagnoses in models weighted to account for sampling design and participation. High UNGD (vs. very low) was associated with depression symptoms in an adjusted negative binomial model (exponentiated coefficient = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.34). High and low UNGD (vs. very low) were associated with depression symptoms (vs. none) in an adjusted multinomial logistic model. Our findings suggest that UNGD may be associated with adverse mental health in Pennsylvania.","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"11375","date":"2018-07-27","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-29747-2","ISSN":"2045-2322","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29747-2","accessDate":"2018-08-02T20:02:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s)","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T20:02:10Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T20:02:10Z"}},{"key":"IGHJQEY9","version":2742,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IGHJQEY9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IGHJQEY9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Epstein","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Epstein, Alex. <i>The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels</i>, 2016.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IGHJQEY9","version":2742,"itemType":"book","title":"The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Epstein"}],"abstractNote":"","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"","publisher":"","date":"2016","numPages":"","language":"","ISBN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:11Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T19:12:02Z"}},{"key":"8REHWFMN","version":2726,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8REHWFMN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8REHWFMN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Konschnik and Dayalu","parsedDate":"2016-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Konschnik, Katherine, and Archana Dayalu. &#x201C;Hydraulic Fracturing Chemicals Reporting: Analysis of Available Data and Recommendations for Policymakers.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 88 (January 1, 2016): 504&#x2013;14. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.002.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"8REHWFMN","version":2726,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Hydraulic fracturing chemicals reporting: Analysis of available data and recommendations for policymakers","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Konschnik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Archana","lastName":"Dayalu"}],"abstractNote":"Twenty-eight states require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Twenty-three states direct reporting to FracFocus; additionally, companies in other states use this registry. FracFocus contains the most comprehensive dataset on fracturing chemicals but faces data quality and transparency criticisms. In response, FracFocus announced upgrades, and since May 2015, publishes aggregated data. We used Linux and R version 3.2.0 to clean and analyze 96,449 forms submitted between March 9, 2011 and April 13, 2015 for accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. We characterize data, and compare results to state law and industry practice, to suggest how to induce more accurate and complete disclosures. We find that rates of withheld chemical information have increased since 2013, and appear unaffected by different legal requirements. However, when companies report fracturing chemicals without attribution to the specific products in the fracturing fluid (a “systems approach” to reporting), withholding rates drop four-fold. State deadlines shortened reporting timelines, but compliance rates are low absent indication states will enforce. Automatic field population and prompts in FracFocus can reduce data error, while enforcement signals, education, and harmonized requirements may boost compliance and enhance disclosure. Systems reporting should occur, with states retaining authority to request product-specific ingredient lists.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"88","issue":"","pages":"504-514","date":"January 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.002","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Hydraulic fracturing chemicals reporting","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515301804","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:13:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Chemicals","type":1},{"tag":"Disclosure","type":1},{"tag":"FracFocus","type":1},{"tag":"Fracturing","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:13:09Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:13:15Z"}},{"key":"APKL635B","version":3618,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/APKL635B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/APKL635B","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Graham et al.","parsedDate":"2015-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Graham, Jove, Jennifer Irving, Xiaoqin Tang, Stephen Sellers, Joshua Crisp, Daniel Horwitz, Lucija Muehlenbachs, Alan Krupnick, and David Carey. &#x201C;Increased Traffic Accident Rates Associated with Shale Gas Drilling in Pennsylvania.&#x201D; <i>Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention</i> 74, no. 0 (January 2015). https://trid.trb.org/view/1334911.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"APKL635B","version":3618,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Increased traffic accident rates associated with shale gas drilling in Pennsylvania","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jove","lastName":"Graham"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Irving"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xiaoqin","lastName":"Tang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Sellers"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Crisp"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Horwitz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lucija","lastName":"Muehlenbachs"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Krupnick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Carey"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","volume":"74","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2015/01/00","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"0001-4575","shortTitle":"","url":"https://trid.trb.org/view/1334911","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:09:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"trid.trb.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:09:49Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:10:04Z"}},{"key":"X9V42PUB","version":2717,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X9V42PUB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X9V42PUB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Northrup et al.","parsedDate":"2015-11-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Northrup, Joseph M., Charles R.

With shale oil and gas resources on nearly every continent, this development is set to become a major driver of global land-use change. It is increasingly critical to quantify spatial habitat loss driven by this development to implement effective mitigation strategies and develop habitat offsets. Habitat selection is a fundamental ecological process, influencing both individual fitness and population-level distribution on the landscape. Examinations of habitat selection provide a natural means for understanding spatial impacts. We examined the impact of natural gas development on habitat selection patterns of mule deer on their winter range in Colorado. We fit resource selection functions in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, with habitat availability defined using a movement-based modeling approach. Energy development drove considerable alterations to deer habitat selection patterns, with the most substantial impacts manifested as avoidance of well pads with active drilling to a distance of at least 800 m. Deer displayed more nuanced responses to other infrastructure, avoiding pads with active production and roads to a greater degree during the day than night. In aggregate, these responses equate to alteration of behavior by human development in over 50% of the critical winter range in our study area during the day and over 25% at night. Compared to other regions, the topographic and vegetative diversity in the study area appear to provide refugia that allow deer to behaviorally mediate some of the impacts of development. This study, and the methods we employed, provides a template for quantifying spatial take by industrial activities in natural areas and the results offer guidance for policy makers, mangers, and industry when attempting to mitigate habitat loss due to energy development.","publicationTitle":"Global Change Biology","volume":"21","issue":"11","pages":"3961-3970","date":"2015-11-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.13037","ISSN":"1365-2486","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13037","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:09:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2015 The Authors.

These governments tend to experience increased revenue from a variety of sources, such as severance taxes distributed by the state government, local property taxes and sales taxes, direct payments from oil and gas companies, and in-kind contributions from those companies. Local governments also tend to face increased demand for services such as road repairs due to heavy truck traffic and from population growth associated with the oil and gas sector. This paper describes the major oil- and gas related revenues and service demands (i.e., costs) that county and municipal governments have experienced in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. Based on extensive interviews with officials in the most heavily affected parts of these states, along with analysis of financial data, it appears that most county and municipal governments have experienced net financial benefits, though some in western North Dakota and eastern Montana appear to have experienced net negative fiscal impacts. Some municipalities in rural Colorado and Wyoming also struggled to manage fiscal impacts during recent oil and gas booms, though these challenges faded as drilling activity slowed.","reportNumber":"w21542","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Cambridge, MA","institution":"National Bureau of Economic Research","date":"09/2015","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Shale Public Finance","url":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w21542.pdf","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:07:29Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.3386/w21542","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:07:29Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:07:32Z"}},{"key":"ZIZ58PUB","version":2708,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZIZ58PUB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZIZ58PUB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rasmussen et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rasmussen, Sara G., Elizabeth L.

Six of the 12 UNGD-outcome associations had increasing ORs across quartiles. Our findings were robust to increasing levels of covariate control and in sensitivity analyses that included evaluation of some possible sources of unmeasured confounding.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Residential UNGD activity metrics were statistically associated with increased risk of mild, moderate, and severe asthma exacerbations.

We do not have a clear idea of what fracking-related policies local governments are adopting, nor how factors such as local government capacity influence policy adoption. We survey 140 local government officials in shale gas drilling areas in four states: Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. We first identify the most common policies local governments use to address fracking and investigate the influence of different types of local capacity on adoption of policies to address fracking. We find that although most communities have not adopted many fracking regulations, higher-capacity communities and those who have experienced a fracking-related accident are more likely to adopt stricter regulations. Local officials are concerned that they lack capacity to address fracking. Our survey asks whether a respondent community did not adopt a policy for legal reasons or other reasons, but did not delve into what those other reasons for non-adoption might be. Our response rate for Louisiana was very low.Takeaway for practice: Local governments appear to have at least some legal room to adopt fracking policy, yet most have not done so proactively. Investing in capacity building in the form of technical assistance or training for local officials would help communities decide how they wish to address fracking from a policy standpoint without waiting for the catalyst of a fracking-related industrial accident.","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Planning Association","volume":"82","issue":"3","pages":"222-235","date":"July 2, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/01944363.2016.1176535","ISSN":"0194-4363","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2016.1176535","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:05:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"capacity","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hazards","type":1},{"tag":"land use","type":1},{"tag":"local government","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:05:35Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:05:43Z"}},{"key":"AV458C23","version":2701,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AV458C23","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AV458C23","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kort et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-16","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kort, E.

Global observations showed declining ethane abundances from 1984 to 2010, while a regional measurement indicated increasing levels since 2009, with the reason for this subject to speculation. The Bakken shale is an oil and gas-producing formation centered in North Dakota that experienced a rapid increase in production beginning in 2010. We use airborne data collected over the North Dakota portion of the Bakken shale in 2014 to calculate ethane emissions of 0.23 ± 0.07 (2σ) Tg/yr, equivalent to 1–3% of total global sources. Emissions of this magnitude impact air quality via concurrent increases in tropospheric ozone. This recently developed large ethane source from one location illustrates the key role of shale oil and gas production in rising global ethane levels.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"9","pages":"4617-4623","date":"2016-05-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL068703","ISSN":"00948276","shortTitle":"Fugitive emissions from the Bakken shale illustrate role of shale production in global ethane shift","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2016GL068703","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:03:12Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:03:12Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:03:14Z"}},{"key":"2XBM6SJF","version":2694,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2XBM6SJF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2XBM6SJF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Milt et al.","parsedDate":"2016-12-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Milt, Austin W., Tamara D.

As an example, shale-gas extraction requires substantial surface infrastructure, which fragments habitats, erodes soils, degrades freshwater systems, and displaces rare species. Strategic planning of shale-gas infrastructure can reduce trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives, but the specific nature of these trade-offs is not known. We estimated the cost of avoiding impacts from land-use change on forests, wetlands, rare species, and streams from shale-energy development within leaseholds. We created software for optimally siting shale-gas surface infrastructure to minimize its environmental impacts at reasonable construction cost. We visually assessed sites before infrastructure optimization to test whether such inspection could be used to predict whether impacts could be avoided at the site. On average, up to 38% of aggregate environmental impacts of infrastructure could be avoided for 20% greater development costs by spatially optimizing infrastructure. However, we found trade-offs between environmental impacts and costs among sites. In visual inspections, we often distinguished between sites that could be developed to avoid impacts at relatively low cost (29%) and those that could not (20%). Reductions in a metric of aggregate environmental impact could be largely attributed to potential displacement of rare species, sedimentation, and forest fragmentation. Planners and regulators can estimate and use heterogeneous trade-offs among development sites to create industry-wide improvements in environmental performance and do so at reasonable costs by, for example, leveraging low-cost avoidance of impacts at some sites to offset others. This could require substantial effort, but the results and software we provide can facilitate the process.","publicationTitle":"Conservation Biology","volume":"30","issue":"6","pages":"1151-1158","date":"2016-12-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"es","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12766","ISSN":"1523-1739","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12766","accessDate":"2018-08-02T17:01:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2016 Society for Conservation Biology","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"access roads","type":1},{"tag":"agrupación de tuberías","type":1},{"tag":"carreteras de acceso","type":1},{"tag":"conjunto de pozos","type":1},{"tag":"conservation planning","type":1},{"tag":"environmental externalities","type":1},{"tag":"externalidades ambientales","type":1},{"tag":"gathering pipelines","type":1},{"tag":"multiobjective planning","type":1},{"tag":"optimización espacial","type":1},{"tag":"planeación de la conservación","type":1},{"tag":"planeación multiobjetiva","type":1},{"tag":"políticas de gas de esquisto","type":1},{"tag":"shale-energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"spatial optimization","type":1},{"tag":"well pads","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T17:01:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T17:01:24Z"}},{"key":"UZE26ZEW","version":3525,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UZE26ZEW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UZE26ZEW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Patterson and Maloney","parsedDate":"2016-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Patterson, Lauren A., and Kelly O.

This study quantified the amount of UOG waste and the distance it traveled between wells and disposal facilities on each type of road in each county between July 2010 and December 2013. In addition, the study estimated the associated financial costs to each county’s road infrastructure over that period. We found that UOG wells produced a median wastewater volume of 1294 m3 and a median of 89,267 kg of solid waste. The median number of waste-transport truck trips per well was 122. UOG wells existed in 38 Pennsylvania counties, but we estimated trucks transporting well waste traveled through 132 counties, including counties in West Virginia, Ohio, and New York. Median travel distance varied by disposal type, from 106 km to centralized treatment facilities up to 237 km to injection wells. Local roads experienced the greatest amount of truck traffic and associated costs ($1.1–6.5 M) and interstates, the least ($0.3–1.6 M). Counties with oil and gas development experienced the most truck traffic and incurred the highest associated roadway costs. However, many counties outside the active development area also incurred roadway repair costs, highlighting the extension of UOG development’s spatial footprint beyond the active development area.

Alternative options include nitrogen and CO2 in some new fracturing methods. However, the fracturing mechanism with water, CO2 and nitrogen has not been clear so far. This paper proposes a numerical model to investigate the impact of water, CO2 and nitrogen fluids on fracturing initiation pressure and seepage area of a shale reservoir. First, the governing equations for anisotropic deformation and anisotropic seepage are further extended for bedding shale. Second, a moving seepage boundary is used for fracturing fluid permeation. Third, a fracture initiation criterion is established based on the stress intensity factor of mode I crack. Fourth, a complex parameter is suggested to express the combined effect of shale permeability, fluid viscosity and pressurization rate. This numerical model is then verified with two sets of experimental data and numerical simulations available in literature. Finally, the impacts of the complex parameter, Biot's coefficient, confining pressure, and critical state on fracturing initiation pressure and seepage area are investigated. The permeability evolution during fracturing initiation process is discussed. It is found that this numerical model has the capability to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process with water, CO2 and nitrogen. Complex parameter, Biot's coefficient and confining pressure have significant impacts on fracturing initiation pressure and seepage area. The fracturing initiation pressure decreases with complex parameter and Biot's coefficient but increases with confining pressure regardless of fracturing fluid type. Water has the highest fracturing initiation pressure and the smallest seepage area. These differences are from the change of effective stress in seepage area, particularly nearby the permeation front. CO2 and nitrogen are good alternative fluids for hydraulic fracturing under the same condition of complex parameter, Biot's coefficient and confining pressure because they have lower fracturing initiation pressure and larger seepage area compared to water.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","volume":"45","issue":"","pages":"291-306","date":"September 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jngse.2017.06.002","ISSN":"1875-5100","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875510017302482","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:57:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Anisotropic shale","type":1},{"tag":"Fracturing fluid","type":1},{"tag":"Fracturing initiation pressure","type":1},{"tag":"Moving mesh","type":1},{"tag":"Seepage area","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:57:53Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:58:02Z"}},{"key":"RGZRL9AV","version":2683,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RGZRL9AV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RGZRL9AV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kang et al.","parsedDate":"2014-12-23","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kang, Mary, Cynthia M.

Prior research has focused on evaluations of air and water quality in particular regions without explicitly considering temporal variation; thus, little is known about the potential effects of UD activity on the environment over longer periods of time. Here, we present an assessment of private well water quality in an area of increasing UD activity over a period of 13months. We analyzed samples from 42 private water wells located in three contiguous counties on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Texas. This area has experienced a rise in UD activity in the last few years, and we analyzed samples in four separate time points to assess variation in groundwater quality over time as UD activities increased. We monitored general water quality parameters as well as several compounds used in UD activities. We found that some constituents remained stable over time, but others experienced significant variation over the period of study. Notable findings include significant changes in total organic carbon and pH along with ephemeral detections of ethanol, bromide, and dichloromethane after the initial sampling phase. These data provide insight into the potentially transient nature of compounds associated with groundwater contamination in areas experiencing UD activity.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"562","issue":"","pages":"906-913","date":"August 15, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.144","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716308476","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:55:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Permian Basin","type":1},{"tag":"Shale energy","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas development","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:55:20Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:55:26Z"}},{"key":"S5J844KT","version":2673,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/S5J844KT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/S5J844KT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lauer et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-17","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lauer, Nancy E., Jennifer S.

Key data gaps exist in understanding the potential impact of underground injection on surface water quality and environmental health. The goal of this study was to assess endocrine disrupting activity in surface water at a West Virginia injection well disposal site. Water samples were collected from a background site in the area and upstream, on, and downstream of the disposal facility. Samples were solid-phase extracted, and extracts assessed for agonist and antagonist hormonal activities for five hormone receptors in mammalian and yeast reporter gene assays. Compared to reference water extracts upstream and distal to the disposal well, samples collected adjacent and downstream exhibited considerably higher antagonist activity for the estrogen, androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors. In contrast, low levels of agonist activity were measured in upstream/distal sites, and were inhibited or absent at downstream sites with significant antagonism. Concurrent analyses by partner laboratories (published separately) describe the analytical and geochemical profiling of the water; elevated conductivity as well as high sodium, chloride, strontium, and barium concentrations indicate impacts due to handling of unconventional oil and gas wastewater. Notably, antagonist activities in downstream samples were at equivalent authentic standard concentrations known to disrupt reproduction and/or development in aquatic animals. Given the widespread use of injection wells for end-disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater, these data raise concerns for human and animal health nearby.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"557-558","issue":"","pages":"901-910","date":"July 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.113","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716305356","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:52:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Endocrine disrupting chemicals","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Injection well","type":1},{"tag":"Wastewater disposal","type":1},{"tag":"Water contamination","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:52:31Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:52:37Z"}},{"key":"G8Z87HUW","version":2656,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/G8Z87HUW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/G8Z87HUW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Peischl et al.","parsedDate":"2016-05-27","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Peischl, J., A.

The Williston Basin is best known for the Bakken shale formation, from which a signiﬁcant increase in oil and gas extraction has occurred since 2009. We derive a CH4 emission rate from this region using airborne data by calculating the CH4 enhancement ﬂux through the planetary boundary layer downwind of the region. We calculate CH4 emissions of (36 ± 13), (27 ± 13), (27 ± 12), (27 ± 12), and (25 ± 10) × 103 kg/h from ﬁve transects on 3 days in May 2014 downwind of the Bakken shale region of North Dakota. The average emission, (28 ± 5) × 103 kg/h, extrapolates to 0.25 ± 0.05 Tg/yr, which is signiﬁcantly lower than a previous estimate of CH4 emissions from northwestern North Dakota and southeastern Saskatchewan using satellite remote sensing data. We attribute the majority of CH4 emissions in the region to oil and gas operations in the Bakken based on the similarity between atmospheric C2H6 to CH4 enhancement ratios and the composition of raw natural gas withdrawn from the region.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"121","issue":"10","pages":"6101-6111","date":"2016-05-27","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2015JD024631","ISSN":"2169897X","shortTitle":"Quantifying atmospheric methane emissions from oil and natural gas production in the Bakken shale region of North Dakota","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2015JD024631","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:50:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:50:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:51:01Z"}},{"key":"CN2C6HI3","version":2656,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CN2C6HI3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CN2C6HI3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bartik et al.","parsedDate":"2017-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bartik, Alexander W, Janet Currie, Michael Greenstone, and Christopher R Knittel. &#x201C;The Local Economic and Welfare Consequences of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#x201D; Working Paper.

However, a rigorous spatial analysis of environmental impacts is necessary to provide a perspective on risk based on proximity to fracking wells. This comment describes the environmental impacts of fracking within a spatial context. It emphasizes five key points: (1) the closer to a hydraulic fracking well, the higher the risk of groundwater and drinking water well contamination; (2) residents living nearest to a fracking well experience a higher human health risk due to exposure to gas emissions during the fracking process; (3) huge and high density gas emissions are detected and recorded close to fracking wells; (4) fracking induces seismicity and small earthquakes are recorded close to fracking wells; and (5) hydraulic fracking directly changes local environment and landscape characteristics. Spatial impact assessments are critical for improving understanding of the impacts of hydraulic fracking on the environment and society.","publicationTitle":"The Extractive Industries and Society","volume":"1","issue":"2","pages":"124-126","date":"November 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Extractive Industries and Society","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.exis.2014.07.004","ISSN":"2214-790X","shortTitle":"Distance","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X14000513","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:50:24Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Distance","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental risks","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Methane migration","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:50:24Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:50:31Z"}},{"key":"IAEA7S8C","version":2649,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IAEA7S8C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IAEA7S8C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rutqvist et al.","parsedDate":"2017-08-17","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rutqvist, J., A.

The analysis shows that for the case representative of GCS, felt seismic events (e.g. moment magnitude 4) could be induced on reservoir-crossing faults whereas in the case representing shale-gas fracturing, only smaller magnitude events, that would likely be unfelt, were calculated. In any case, the initial stress field as well as the rock properties, whether more ductile or brittle, are important conditions that will determine whether a felt seismic events could be induced.

However, a dramatic increase in seismic activity between 2009 and the present, widely attributed to wastewater injection associated with oil and gas production, is a new and highly salient consequence of development. This research engages Oklahoma residents through open-ended interviews on their experience of and reaction to earthquakes. We use these interviews to characterize how energy narratives emerge in response to conflict between environmental outcomes and economic interest associated with a long-standing industry that is personally important to many in the state. We find that seismicity has fractured the dominant narrative of oil and gas development as important for the state into descendant narratives framing seismicity as a minor problem that will be resolved without affecting the oil and gas industry significantly, as a major problem that warrants opposition to the oil and gas industry, or as a problem that needs to be addressed, but not at the cost of all oil and gas development. Trust and a sense of personal efficacy are important in determining people’s reactions, and loss of trust in government is more widely observed than loss of trust in industry.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"31","issue":"","pages":"128-136","date":"September 1, 2017","series":"Narratives and Storytelling in Energy and Climate Change Research","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.039","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Fault lines","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629617301688","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:47:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Induced seismicity","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Oklahoma","type":1},{"tag":"Society","type":1}],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:47:13Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:47:13Z"}},{"key":"3JTB4BEF","version":2643,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3JTB4BEF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3JTB4BEF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McClure et al.","parsedDate":"2017-03-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McClure, Mark, Riley Gibson, Kit-Kwan Chiu, and Rajesh Ranganath. &#x201C;Identifying Potentially Induced Seismicity and Assessing Statistical Significance in Oklahoma and California.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</i> 122, no. 3 (March 1, 2017): 2153&#x2013;72. https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JB013711.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3JTB4BEF","version":2643,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Identifying potentially induced seismicity and assessing statistical significance in Oklahoma and California","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mark","lastName":"McClure"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Riley","lastName":"Gibson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kit-Kwan","lastName":"Chiu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Ranganath"}],"abstractNote":"We develop a statistical method for identifying induced seismicity from large data sets and apply the method to decades of wastewater disposal and seismicity data in California and Oklahoma. The study regions are divided into grid blocks. We use a longitudinal study design, seeking associations between seismicity and wastewater injection volume along time series within each grid block. In each grid block, we find the maximum likelihood estimate for a model parameter that relates induced seismicity hazard to total volume of wastewater injected each year. To assess significance, we compute likelihood ratio test statistics in each grid block and each state, California and Oklahoma. Resampling with permutation and random temporal offset of injection data is used to estimate p values from the likelihood ratio statistics. We focus on assessing whether observed associations between injection and seismicity occur more often than would be expected by chance; we do not attempt to quantify the overall incidence of induced seismicity. The study is designed so that, under reasonable assumptions, the associations can be formally interpreted as demonstrating causality. Wastewater disposal is associated with other activities that can induce seismicity, such as reservoir depletion. Therefore, our results should be interpreted as finding seismicity induced by wastewater disposal and all other associated activities. In Oklahoma, the analysis finds with extremely high confidence that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal has occurred. In California, the analysis finds moderate evidence that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal has occurred, but the result is not strong enough to be conclusive.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","volume":"122","issue":"3","pages":"2153-2172","date":"2017-03-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016JB013711","ISSN":"2169-9356","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JB013711","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:47:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2017.

We combine geophysical and drill hole data to map subsurface geologic features in the crystalline basement, where most earthquakes are occurring, and examine probable contributing factors. We find that most earthquakes are located where the crystalline basement is likely composed of fractured intrusive or metamorphic rock. Areas with extrusive rock or thick (>4 km) sedimentary cover exhibit little seismicity, even in high injection rate areas, similar to deep sedimentary basins in Michigan and western North Dakota. These differences in seismicity may be due to variations in permeability structure: within intrusive rocks, fluids can become narrowly focused in fractures and faults, causing an increase in local pore fluid pressure, whereas more distributed pore space in sedimentary and extrusive rocks may relax pore fluid pressure.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"44","issue":"1","pages":"152161","date":"2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL071808","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Geologic influence on induced seismicity","url":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189110","accessDate":"2018-08-02T16:45:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.er.usgs.gov","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"IP-075927","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T16:45:31Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T16:45:31Z"}},{"key":"Q3YVA3NZ","version":2639,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q3YVA3NZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q3YVA3NZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mayer","parsedDate":"2018-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mayer, Adam. &#x201C;The Fiscal Impacts of Energy: Perspectives from Local Governments in the Mountain West, USA.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 122 (November 1, 2018): 186&#x2013;93. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.043.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Q3YVA3NZ","version":2639,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Fiscal Impacts of Energy: Perspectives from local governments in the Mountain West, USA","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Mayer"}],"abstractNote":"Over the past two decades, the U.S. energy sector has undergone significant transition. Coal— historically the primary power source for the U.S. economy—has declined markedly in both production and consumption. Renewables like wind and solar have become much more economically viable in recent years. However, perhaps the most dramatic change has been the drastic increase in oil and gas production since the mid-2000s, due largely to the convergence of unconventional technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. The changing energy system presents both opportunities and challenges for local governments, especially those in rural areas that face unique fiscal struggles. In this paper, we present results of a survey of local policy actors in the Mountain West states of Colorado and Utah. Policy actors assessed the fiscal and public service impacts of different types of energy development and we tie these survey responses to spatial energy development data. Results imply that policy actors have nuanced views of all types of energy, though fossil fuels (especially coal) are generally seen as more fiscally beneficial than renewables. Generally, the spatial proximity of a type of energy development has only a weak relationship with perceived fiscal and public service costs and benefits.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"122","issue":"","pages":"186-193","date":"November 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.043","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"The Fiscal Impacts of Energy","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518304907","accessDate":"2018-08-02T15:21:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Fiscal impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Local governments","type":1},{"tag":"Policy actors","type":1}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T15:21:34Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T15:21:34Z"}},{"key":"9K3GZ2AB","version":2632,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9K3GZ2AB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9K3GZ2AB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yoon et al.","parsedDate":"2015-05-26","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yoon, Jeoung Seok, G&#xFC;nter Zimmermann, Arno Zang, and Ove Stephansson. &#x201C;Discrete Element Modeling of Fluid Injection&#x2013;Induced Seismicity and Activation of Nearby Fault.&#x201D; <i>Canadian Geotechnical Journal</i> 52, no. 10 (May 26, 2015): 1457&#x2013;65. https://doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2014-0435.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9K3GZ2AB","version":2632,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Discrete element modeling of fluid injection–induced seismicity and activation of nearby fault","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeoung Seok","lastName":"Yoon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Günter","lastName":"Zimmermann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Arno","lastName":"Zang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ove","lastName":"Stephansson"}],"abstractNote":"Enhanced geothermal systems, shale gas, and geological carbon sequestration all require underground fluid injection in high-pressure conditions. Fluid injection creates fractures, induces seismicity, and has the potential to reactivate nearby faults that can generate a large magnitude earthquake. Mechanisms of fluid injection–induced seismicity and fault reactivation should be better understood to be able to mitigate larger events triggered by fluid injection. This study investigates fluid injection, induced seismicity, and triggering of fault rupture using hydromechanical-coupled discrete element models. Results show that a small amount of fluid pressure perturbation can trigger fault ruptures that are critically oriented and stressed. Induced seismicity by rock failure shows in general higher b-values (slope of magnitude–frequency relation) compared to seismicity triggered by the fault fracture slip. Numerical results closely resemble observations from geothermal and shale-gas fields and demonstrate that discrete element modeling has the potential to be applied in the field as a tool for predicting induced seismicity prior to in situ injection.","publicationTitle":"Canadian Geotechnical Journal","volume":"52","issue":"10","pages":"1457-1465","date":"May 26, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Can.

Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) development is one emerging stressor that spans the U.S. UOG development could alter stream sedimentation, riparian extent and composition, in-stream flow, and water quality. We developed indices to describe the watershed sensitivity and exposure to natural and anthropogenic disturbances and computed a vulnerability index from these two scores across stream catchments in six productive shale plays. We predicted that catchment vulnerability scores would vary across plays due to climatic, geologic and anthropogenic differences. Across-shale averages supported this prediction revealing differences in catchment sensitivity, exposure, and vulnerability scores that resulted from different natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions. For example, semi-arid Western shale play catchments (Mowry, Hilliard, and Bakken) tended to be more sensitive to stressors due to low annual average precipitation and extensive grassland. Catchments in the Barnett and Marcellus-Utica were naturally sensitive from more erosive soils and steeper catchment slopes, but these catchments also experienced areas with greater UOG densities and urbanization. Our analysis suggested Fayetteville and Barnett catchments were vulnerable due to existing anthropogenic exposure. However, all shale plays had catchments that spanned a wide vulnerability gradient. Our results identify vulnerable catchments that can help prioritize stream protection and monitoring efforts. Resource managers can also use these findings to guide local development activities to help reduce possible environmental effects.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"9","pages":"e0137416","date":"2015-9-23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0137416","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"Stream Vulnerability to Widespread and Emergent Stressors","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137416","accessDate":"2018-08-02T15:01:12Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Chemical precipitation","type":1},{"tag":"Crops","type":1},{"tag":"Oils","type":1},{"tag":"Sediment","type":1},{"tag":"Sedimentation","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Surface water","type":1},{"tag":"Wetlands","type":1}],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T15:01:12Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T15:01:20Z"}},{"key":"PQYDKACQ","version":2628,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PQYDKACQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PQYDKACQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McNamara et al.","parsedDate":"2015-10-28","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McNamara, D.

This region also supports a particularly high density and diversity of grassland bird species, which are declining across North America. We examined grassland bird response to unconventional oil extraction sites (i.e. developed with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques) and associated roads in North Dakota. Our goal was to quantify the amount of habitat that was indirectly degraded by oil development, as evidenced by patterns of avoidance by birds. Grassland birds avoided areas within 150m of roads (95% CI: 87–214m), 267m of single-bore well pads (95% CI: 157–378m), and 150m of multi-bore well pads (95% CI: 67–233m). Individual species demonstrated variable tolerance of well pads. Clay-colored sparrows (Spizella pallida) were tolerant of oil-related infrastructure, whereas Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii) avoided areas within 350m (95% CI: 215–485m) of single-bore well pads. Given these density patterns around oil wells, the potential footprint of any individual oil well, and oil development across the region, is greatly multiplied for sensitive species. Efforts to reduce new road construction, concentrate wells along developed corridors, combine numerous wells on multi-bore pads rather than build many single-bore wells, and to place well pads near existing roads will serve to minimize loss of suitable habitat for birds. Quantifying environmental degradation caused by oil development is a critical step in understanding how to better mitigate harm to wildlife populations.","publicationTitle":"Biological Conservation","volume":"192","issue":"","pages":"82-90","date":"December 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Biological Conservation","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2015.08.040","ISSN":"0006-3207","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715300902","accessDate":"2018-08-02T14:50:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Bakken","type":1},{"tag":"Grassland birds","type":1},{"tag":"Oil development","type":1},{"tag":"Piecewise regression","type":1},{"tag":"Sprague's pipit","type":1}],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T14:50:26Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T14:50:46Z"}},{"key":"G2M4HHWC","version":3277,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/G2M4HHWC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/G2M4HHWC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mauter et al.","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mauter, Meagan S., Pedro J.

However, it is unclear whether these chemicals, injected into deep shale horizons, reach shallow groundwater aquifers and affect local water quality, either from those deep HVHF injection sites or from the surface or shallow subsurface. Here, we report detectable levels of organic compounds in shallow groundwater samples from private residential wells overlying the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. Analyses of purgeable and extractable organic compounds from 64 groundwater samples revealed trace levels of volatile organic compounds, well below the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant levels, and low levels of both gasoline range (0–8 ppb) and diesel range organic compounds (DRO; 0–157 ppb). A compound-specific analysis revealed the presence of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, which is a disclosed HVHF additive, that was notably absent in a representative geogenic water sample and field blanks. Pairing these analyses with (i) inorganic chemical fingerprinting of deep saline groundwater, (ii) characteristic noble gas isotopes, and (iii) spatial relationships between active shale gas extraction wells and wells with disclosed environmental health and safety violations, we differentiate between a chemical signature associated with naturally occurring saline groundwater and one associated with alternative anthropogenic routes from the surface (e.g., accidental spills or leaks). The data support a transport mechanism of DRO to groundwater via accidental release of fracturing fluid chemicals derived from the surface rather than subsurface flow of these fluids from the underlying shale formation.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"43","pages":"13184-13189","date":"2015/10/27","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1511474112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/43/13184","accessDate":"2018-08-02T14:44:25Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26460018","tags":[{"tag":"groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"high-volume hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"hydrophobic organic contaminants","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"transport mechanisms","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-02T14:44:25Z","dateModified":"2018-08-02T14:44:33Z"}},{"key":"Z5W2E2EU","version":2595,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z5W2E2EU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z5W2E2EU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gallegos et al.","parsedDate":"2015-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gallegos, Tanya J., Brian A.

Although median annual volumes of 15,275 m3 and 19,425 m3 of water per well was used to hydraulically fracture individual horizontal oil and gas wells, respectively, in 2014, about 42% of wells were actually either vertical or directional, which required less than 2600 m3 water per well. The highest average hydraulic fracturing water usage (10,000−36,620 m3 per well) in watersheds across the United States generally correlated with shale-gas areas (versus coalbed methane, tight oil, or tight gas) where the greatest proportion of hydraulically fractured wells were horizontally drilled, reflecting that the natural reservoir properties influence water use. This analysis also demonstrates that many oil and gas resources within a given basin are developed using a mix of horizontal, vertical, and some directional wells, explaining why large volume hydraulic fracturing water usage is not widespread. This spatial variability in hydraulic fracturing water use relates to the potential for environmental impacts such as water availability, water quality, wastewater disposal, and possible wastewater injection-induced earthquakes.","publicationTitle":"Water Resources Research","volume":"51","issue":"7","pages":"5839-5845","date":"2015-07-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2015WR017278","ISSN":"1944-7973","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015WR017278","accessDate":"2018-08-02T14:39:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2015.

If left improperly sealed, legacy oil and gas wells colocated with that new development represent a potential pathway for unwanted migration of fluids (brine, drilling and stimulation fluids, oil, and gas). Uncertainty in the number, location, and abandonment state of legacy wells hinders environmental assessment of exploration and production activity. The objective of this study is to apply publicly available information on Pennsylvania oil and gas wells to better understand their potential to serve as pathways for unwanted fluid migration. This study presents a synthesis of historical reports and digital well records to provide insights into spatial and temporal trends in oil and gas development. Areas with a higher density of wells abandoned prior to the mid-20th century, when more modern well-sealing requirements took effect in Pennsylvania, and areas where conventional oil and gas production penetrated to or through intervals that may be affected by new Marcellus shale development are identified. This information may help to address questions of environmental risk related to new extraction activities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"20","pages":"12015-12023","date":"October 20, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Most accounts of groundwater contamination have focused primarily on the compositional analysis of dissolved gases to address whether UOG activities have had deleterious effects on overlying aquifers. Here, we present an analysis of 550 groundwater samples collected from private and public supply water wells drawing from aquifers overlying the Barnett shale formation of Texas. We detected multiple volatile organic carbon compounds throughout the region, including various alcohols, the BTEX family of compounds, and several chlorinated compounds. These data do not necessarily identify UOG activities as the source of contamination; however, they do provide a strong impetus for further monitoring and analysis of groundwater quality in this region as many of the compounds we detected are known to be associated with UOG techniques.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8254-8262","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This study estimates methane emissions from the transmission and storage (T&S) sector of the United States natural gas industry using new data collected during 2012, including 2,292 onsite measurements, additional emissions data from 677 facilities and activity data from 922 facilities. The largest emission sources were fugitive emissions from certain compressor-related equipment and “super-emitter” facilities. We estimate total methane emissions from the T&S sector at 1,503 [1,220 to 1,950] Gg/yr (95% conﬁdence interval) compared to the 2012 Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimate of 2,071 [1,680 to 2,690] Gg/yr. While the overlap in conﬁdence intervals indicates that the diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant, this is the result of several signiﬁcant, but oﬀsetting, factors. Factors which reduce the study estimate include a lower estimated facility count, a shift away from engines toward lower-emitting turbine and electric compressor drivers, and reductions in the usage of gas-driven pneumatic devices. Factors that increase the study estimate relative to the GHGI include updated emission rates in certain emission categories and explicit treatment of skewed emissions at both component and facility levels. For T&S stations that are required to report to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), this study estimates total emissions to be 260% [215% to 330%] of the reportable emissions for these stations, primarily due to the inclusion of emission sources that are not reported under the GHGRP rules, updated emission factors, and super-emitter emissions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"15","pages":"9374-9383","date":"2015-08-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.5b01669","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5b01669","accessDate":"2018-08-01T22:58:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:58:36Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T22:58:38Z"}},{"key":"3U4C3GZF","version":2571,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3U4C3GZF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3U4C3GZF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"LOWER-CARBON et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">LOWER-CARBON, A, CLEANER-ENERGY FUTURE, Michael E Porter, David S Gee, and Gregory J Pope. &#x201C;AMERICA&#x2019;S UNCONVENTIONAL ENERGY OPPORTUNITY,&#x201D; n.d., 72.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3U4C3GZF","version":2571,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"AMERICA’S UNCONVENTIONAL ENERGY OPPORTUNITY","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"A","lastName":"LOWER-CARBON"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"CLEANER-ENERGY","lastName":"FUTURE"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael E","lastName":"Porter"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David S","lastName":"Gee"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gregory J","lastName":"Pope"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"72","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:58:04Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T22:58:04Z"}},{"key":"KVX4EWSQ","version":2562,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KVX4EWSQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KVX4EWSQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weingarten et al.","parsedDate":"2015-06-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weingarten, M., S.

Weingarten et al. combined information from public injection-well databases from the eastern and central United States with the best earthquake catalog available over the past 30 years. The rate of fluid injection into a well appeared to be the most likely decisive triggering factor in regions prone to induced earthquakes. Along these lines, Walsh III and Zoback found a clear correlation between areas in Oklahoma where waste saltwater is being injected on a large scale and areas experiencing increased earthquake activity.\nScience, this issue p. 1336; Sci. Adv. 10.1126/sciadv.1500195 (2015).\nAn unprecedented increase in earthquakes in the U.S. mid-continent began in 2009. Many of these earthquakes have been documented as induced by wastewater injection. We examine the relationship between wastewater injection and U.S. mid-continent seismicity using a newly assembled injection well database for the central and eastern United States. We find that the entire increase in earthquake rate is associated with fluid injection wells. High-rate injection wells (>300,000 barrels per month) are much more likely to be associated with earthquakes than lower-rate wells. At the scale of our study, a well’s cumulative injected volume, monthly wellhead pressure, depth, and proximity to crystalline basement do not strongly correlate with earthquake association. Managing injection rates may be a useful tool to minimize the likelihood of induced earthquakes.\nHigh injection rates of wastewater into deep wells increase the risk of earthquakes in regions prone to induced seismicity.\nHigh injection rates of wastewater into deep wells increase the risk of earthquakes in regions prone to induced seismicity.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"348","issue":"6241","pages":"1336-1340","date":"2015/06/19","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aab1345","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6241/1336","accessDate":"2018-08-01T22:55:37Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 26089509","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:55:37Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T22:55:48Z"}},{"key":"ZMVQDCEG","version":2559,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZMVQDCEG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZMVQDCEG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Allred et al.","parsedDate":"2015-04-24","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Allred, Brady W., W.

In Pennsylvania, the number of producing wells increased from 0 in 2005 to 3,689 in 2013. Few publications have focused on unconventional natural gas development and birth outcomes.\n        Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data on 9,384 mothers linked to 10,946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System from January 2009 to January 2013. We estimated cumulative exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity with an inverse-distance squared model that incorporated distance to the mother’s home; dates and durations of well pad development, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing; and production volume during the pregnancy. We used multilevel linear and logistic regression models to examine associations between activity index quartile and term birth weight, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score and small size for gestational age birth, while controlling for potential confounding variables.\n        Results: In adjusted models, there was an association between unconventional natural gas development activity and preterm birth that increased across quartiles, with a fourth quartile odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.9). There were no associations of activity with Apgar score, small for gestational age birth, or term birth weight (after adjustment for year). In a posthoc analysis, there was an association with physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy identified from the problem list (fourth vs. first quartile, 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.7]).\n        Conclusion: Prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with two pregnancy outcomes, adding to evidence that unconventional natural gas development may impact health.\n        See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B14.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology","volume":"27","issue":"2","pages":"163","date":"March 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en-US","DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000000387","ISSN":"1044-3983","shortTitle":"","url":"https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/2016/03000/Unconventional_Natural_Gas_Development_and_Birth.2.aspx","accessDate":"2018-08-01T22:53:41Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.lww.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:53:41Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T22:53:49Z"}},{"key":"NVYPNACZ","version":2547,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NVYPNACZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NVYPNACZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kondash and Vengosh","parsedDate":"2015-10-13","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kondash, Andrew, and Avner Vengosh. &#x201C;Water Footprint of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters</i> 2, no. 10 (October 13, 2015): 276&#x2013;80. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00211.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"NVYPNACZ","version":2547,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Water Footprint of Hydraulic Fracturing","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Kondash"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Avner","lastName":"Vengosh"}],"abstractNote":"We evaluated the overall water footprint of hydraulic fracturing of unconventional shale gas and oil throughout the United States based on integrated data from multiple database sources.

We examined and interpreted 13,040 analyses from pre-drilling groundwater samples from domestic water wells in northeastern (NE) Pennsylvania and 8004 samples from water wells in the “Western Area” which includes southwest Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and north-central West Virginia. These samples were acquired on behalf of Chesapeake Energy Corporation as part of its local pre-drilling water supply monitoring program. We evaluated concentrations of major ions and metals relative to federal drinking-water-quality standards upon which regulatory decisions are often based. Chesapeake’s dataset, the most comprehensive for these areas, shows that exceedance of at least one water-quality standard occurs in 63% of water well samples in NE Pennsylvania and 87% in the Western Area. In NE Pennsylvania, 10% of the samples exceeded one or more of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) primary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking-water supplies, 46.1% of the samples exceeded one or more of USEPA secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs), and another 7% exceeded one or more of USEPA health advisory or regional screening levels for tap water.In the Western Area 8% of samples exceeded one or more MCLs, 65% exceeded one or more SMCLs, and 15% exceeded one or more health advisory or regional screening levels for tap water. Chesapeake’s dataset, orders of magnitude larger than any in previously published literature, shows that water-quality exceedances relate to factors such: as where the sample occurs within the groundwater flow system, the natural groundwater chemical type (hydrochemical facies), the geologic unit producing the water, and/or the topographic position (valley versus upland). Our comparison of these results to historical groundwater data from NE Pennsylvania, which pre-dates most unconventional shale gas development, shows that the recent pre-drilling geochemical data is similar to historical data. We see no broad changes in variability of chemical quality in this large dataset to suggest any unusual salinization caused by possible release of produced waters from oil and gas operations, even after thousands of gas wells have been drilled among tens of thousands of domestic wells within the two areas studied. Our evaluation also agrees with early researchers such as Piper (1933) and Lohman (1939, 1937) who found that the saline waters in both areas underlie fresher groundwater. The saline water is naturally-occurring connate brine or salt water which has not been flushed by circulating meteoric water; rather than vertical migration of salt water from deep strata such as the Marcellus shale as suggested by Warner et al. (2012). Elevated metals concentrations, particularly iron and manganese, partly relate to sample turbidity; dissolved metals would provide a more accurate measurement of metals in shallow groundwater than does the total metals analysis typically required by regulations.","publicationTitle":"Applied Geochemistry","volume":"C","issue":"63","pages":"37-57","date":"2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"English","DOI":"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2015.06.013","ISSN":"0883-2927","shortTitle":"Pre-drilling water-quality data of groundwater prior to shale gas drilling in the Appalachian Basin","url":"https://www.infona.pl//resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-db8611c3-aab0-3ad6-878c-1c638f3c3e42","accessDate":"2018-08-01T22:51:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.infona.pl","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T22:51:03Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T22:51:08Z"}},{"key":"B8ZSTA7L","version":2541,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/B8ZSTA7L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/B8ZSTA7L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gallagher et al.","parsedDate":"2015-10-13","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gallagher, Morgan E., Adrian Down, Robert C.

This energetic sequence has produced five earthquakes with Mw 4.4 or larger. Almost all of these earthquakes occur in Precambrian basement on a partially unmapped 14 km long fault. Regional injection into the Arbuckle Group increased approximately sevenfold in the 36 months prior to the start of the sequence (January 2015). We suggest far-field pressurization from clustered, high-rate wells greater than 12 km from this sequence induced these earthquakes. As compared to the Fairview sequence, seismicity is diffuse near high-rate wells, where pressure changes are expected to be largest. This points to the critical role that preexisting faults play in the occurrence of large induced earthquakes.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"19","pages":"10,198-10,207","date":"2016-10-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL070861","ISSN":"1944-8007","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL070861","accessDate":"2018-08-01T19:22:28Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2016.

However, hydrophobic MD membranes are prone to wetting by low surface tension substances, thereby limiting their use in treating challenging industrial wastewaters, such as shale gas produced water. In this study, we present a facile and scalable approach for the fabrication of omniphobic polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes that repel both water and oil. Positive surface charge was imparted to an alkaline-treated PVDF membrane by aminosilane functionalization, which enabled irreversible binding of negatively charged silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to the membrane through electrostatic attraction. The membrane with grafted SiNPs was then coated with ﬂuoroalkylsilane (perﬂuorodecyltrichlorosilane) to lower the membrane surface energy. Results from contact angle measurements with mineral oil and surfactant solution demonstrated that overlaying SiNPs with ultralow surface energy signiﬁcantly enhanced the wetting resistance of the membrane against low surface tension liquids. We also evaluated desalination performance of the modiﬁed membrane in direct contact membrane distillation with a synthetic wastewater containing surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and mineral oil, as well as with shale gas produced water. The omniphobic membrane exhibited a stable MD performance, demonstrating its potential application for desalination of challenging industrial wastewaters containing diverse low surface tension contaminants.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"22","pages":"12275-12282","date":"2016-11-15","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.6b03882","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b03882","accessDate":"2018-08-01T19:08:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T19:08:10Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T19:08:10Z"}},{"key":"4WJY8VMY","version":2499,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4WJY8VMY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4WJY8VMY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Elliott et al.","parsedDate":"2017-01-15","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Elliott, Elise G., Pauline Trinh, Xiaomei Ma, Brian P.

Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (>80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"576","issue":"","pages":"138-147","date":"January 15, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.072","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"Unconventional oil and gas development and risk of childhood leukemia","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716322392","accessDate":"2018-08-01T19:06:57Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air pollution","type":1},{"tag":"Carcinogens","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Shale","type":1},{"tag":"Wastewater","type":1},{"tag":"Water contamination","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T19:06:58Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T19:07:05Z"}},{"key":"U39A9PZX","version":2495,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/U39A9PZX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/U39A9PZX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Eveline et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-26","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Eveline, Vena F., I.

This characteristic may arise from a break in scale invariance, possibly due to mechanical layering that typifies fine-grained sedimentary rocks in many shale gas and tight oil reservoirs. The latter would imply the presence of spatiotemporal magnitude correlations. Using three microseismic catalogs for well stimulations in widely separated locations with varying hydraulic-fracturing methods, we show that events with similar magnitudes indeed tend to cluster in space and time. In addition, we show that the interevent time distribution can be described by a universal functional form characterized by two power laws. One exponent can be related to the presence of interevent triggering as in aftershock sequences and is a consequence of the Omori-Utsu law. The other one is a reflection of the intrinsic spatial variation in the microseismic response rates. Taken together, these features are indicative of nontrivial spatiotemporal clustering of induced microseismicity and, hence, of direct relevance for time-dependent seismic hazard assessment.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"20","pages":"10,672-10,679","date":"2016-10-28","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL070983","ISSN":"1944-8007","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL070983","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:57:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2016.

Here we present a reconnaissance analysis of groundwater quality in the Eagle Ford region of southern Texas. These data reveal two distinct sample populations that are differentiable by bromide/chloride ratios. Elevated levels of fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, various metal ions, and the detection of exotic volatile organic compounds highlight a high bromide group of samples, which is geographically clustered, while encompassing multiple hydrogeological strata. Samples with bromide/chloride ratios representative of connate water displayed elevated levels of total organic carbon, while revealing the detection of alcohols and chlorinated compounds. These findings suggest that groundwater quality in the Western Gulf Basin is, for the most part, controlled by a series of natural processes; however, there is also evidence of episodic contamination events potentially attributed to unconventional oil and gas development or other anthropogenic activities. Collectively, this characterization of natural groundwater constituents and exogenous compounds will guide targeted remediation efforts and provides insight for agricultural entities, industrial operators, and rural communities that rely on groundwater in southern Texas.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"575","issue":"","pages":"672-680","date":"January 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.070","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716319891","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:54:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Eagle Ford","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Shale energy extraction","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:54:01Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:54:08Z"}},{"key":"359V6DUA","version":2479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/359V6DUA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/359V6DUA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pesicek et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Pesicek, Jeremy, Konrad Cie&#x15B;lik, Marc-Andr&#xE9; Lambert, Pedro Carrillo, and Brad Birkelo. &#x201C;Dense Surface Seismic Data Confirm Non-Double-Couple Source Mechanisms Induced by Hydraulic Fracturing.&#x201D; <i>Geophysics</i> 81, no. 6 (2016): KS207KS217. https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2016-0192.1.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"359V6DUA","version":2479,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dense surface seismic data confirm non-double-couple source mechanisms induced by hydraulic fracturing","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Pesicek"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Cieślik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marc-André","lastName":"Lambert"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Carrillo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Birkelo"}],"abstractNote":"We have determined source mechanisms for nine high-quality microseismic events induced during hydraulic fracturing of the Montney Shale in Canada. Seismic data were recorded using a dense regularly spaced grid of sensors at the surface. The design and geometry of the survey are such that the recorded P-wave amplitudes essentially map the upper focal hemisphere, allowing the source mechanism to be interpreted directly from the data. Given the inherent difficulties of computing reliable moment tensors (MTs) from high-frequency microseismic data, the surface amplitude and polarity maps provide important additional confirmation of the source mechanisms. This is especially critical when interpreting non-shear source processes, which are notoriously susceptible to artifacts due to incomplete or inaccurate source modeling. We have found that most of the nine events contain significant non-double-couple (DC) components, as evident in the surface amplitude data and the resulting MT models. Furthermore, we found that source models that are constrained to be purely shear do not explain the data for most events. Thus, even though non-DC components of MTs can often be attributed to modeling artifacts, we argue that they are required by the data in some cases, and can be reliably computed and confidently interpreted under favorable conditions.","publicationTitle":"Geophysics","volume":"81","issue":"6","pages":"KS207KS217","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1190/geo2016-0192.1","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178647","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:53:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.er.usgs.gov","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"IP-075074","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:53:45Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:53:45Z"}},{"key":"QTSQYEH7","version":2479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QTSQYEH7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QTSQYEH7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Shirzaei et al.","parsedDate":"2016-09-23","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Shirzaei, Manoochehr, William L.

Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"353","issue":"6306","pages":"1416-1419","date":"2016/09/23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aag0262","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6306/1416%20","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:53:23Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 27708035","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:53:22Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:53:44Z"}},{"key":"89GSNJDN","version":2475,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/89GSNJDN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/89GSNJDN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marrero et al.","parsedDate":"2016-10-04","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Marrero, Josette E., Amy Townsend-Small, David R.

During the Barnett Shale Coordinated Campaign in October, 2013, ground-based whole air samples collected downwind of oil and gas sites revealed enhancements in several potentially toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when compared to background values. Molar emissions ratios relative to methane were determined for hexane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX compounds). Using methane leak rates measured from the Picarro mobile flux plane (MFP) system and a Barnett Shale regional methane emissions inventory, the rates of emission of these toxic gases were calculated. Benzene emissions ranged between 51 ± 4 and 60 ± 4 kg h–1. Hexane, the most abundantly emitted pollutant, ranged from 642 ± 45 to 1070 ± 340 kg h–1. While observed hydrocarbon enhancements fall below federal workplace standards, results may indicate a link between emissions from oil and natural gas operations and concerns about exposure to hazardous air pollutants. The larger public health risks associated with the production and distribution of natural gas are of particular importance and warrant further investigation, particularly as the use of natural gas increases in the United States and internationally.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"19","pages":"10756-10764","date":"October 4, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Addressing this need, we studied current patterns of hydrologic alteration in the Marcellus Shale region and related the estimated flow alteration to fish community measures. We then used these empirical flow–ecology relationships to evaluate alternative surface water withdrawals and environmental flow rules. Reduced high-flow magnitude, dampened rates of change, and increased low-flow magnitudes were apparent regionally, but changes in many of the flow metrics likely to be sensitive to withdrawals also showed substantial regional variation. Fish community measures were significantly related to flow alteration, including declines in species richness with diminished annual runoff, winter low-flow, and summer median-flow. In addition, the relative abundance of intolerant taxa decreased with reduced winter high-flow and increased flow constancy, while fluvial specialist species decreased with reduced winter and annual flows. Stream size strongly mediated both the impact of withdrawal scenarios and the protection afforded by environmental flow standards. Under the most intense withdrawal scenario, 75% of reference headwaters and creeks (drainage areas <99 km2) experienced at least 78% reduction in summer flow, whereas little change was predicted for larger rivers. Moreover, the least intense withdrawal scenario still reduced summer flows by at least 21% for 50% of headwaters and creeks. The observed 90th quantile flow–ecology relationships indicate that such alteration could reduce species richness by 23% or more. Seasonally varying environmental flow standards and high fixed minimum flows protected the most streams from hydrologic alteration, but common minimum flow standards left numerous locations vulnerable to substantial flow alteration. This study clarifies how additional water demands in the region may adversely affect freshwater biological integrity. The results make clear that policies to limit or prevent water withdrawals from smaller streams can reduce the risk of ecosystem impairment.","publicationTitle":"Ecological Applications","volume":"27","issue":"1","pages":"37-55","date":"2017-01-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1425","ISSN":"1939-5582","shortTitle":"","url":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1425","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:51:36Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Appalachia","type":1},{"tag":"Marcellus Shale","type":1},{"tag":"environmental flows","type":1},{"tag":"fish","type":1},{"tag":"flow regime","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1}],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:51:36Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:51:36Z"}},{"key":"BDFLQNEC","version":2466,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BDFLQNEC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BDFLQNEC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Daly et al.","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Daly, Rebecca A., Mikayla A.

Here, we evaluate trends in HF water use relative to supplies and FP water relative to disposal using well by well analysis in the Bakken Play. HF water use per well increased by ∼6 times from 2005−2014, totaling 24.5 × 109 gal (93 × 109 L) for ∼10 140 wells. Water supplies expanded to meet increased demand, including access of up to ∼33 × 109 gal/year (125 × 109 L/year) from Lake Sakakawea, expanding pipeline infrastructure by hundreds of miles and allowing water transfers from irrigation. The projected inventory of ∼60 000 future wells should require an additional ∼11 times more HF water. Cumulative FP water has been managed by disposal into an increasing number (277 to 479) of salt water disposal wells. FP water is projected to increase by ∼10 times during the play lifetime (∼40 years). Disposal of FP water into deeper geologic units should be considered because of reported overpressuring of parts of the Dakota Group. The long time series shows how policies have increased water supplies for HF and highlights potential issues related to FP water management.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"18","pages":"10273-10281","date":"2016-09-20","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.6b01375","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b01375","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:49:04Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:49:04Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:49:05Z"}},{"key":"QL3A6ITD","version":2452,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QL3A6ITD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QL3A6ITD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"DiGiulio and Jackson","parsedDate":"2016-04-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">DiGiulio, Dominic C., and Robert B.

Although injection of stimulation fluids into USDWs in the Pavillion Field was documented by EPA, potential impact to USDWs at the depths of stimulation as a result of this activity was not previously evaluated. Concentrations of major ions in produced water samples outside expected levels in the Wind River Formation, leakoff of stimulation fluids into formation media, and likely loss of zonal isolation during stimulation at several production wells, indicates that impact to USDWs has occurred. Detection of organic compounds used for well stimulation in samples from two monitoring wells installed by EPA, plus anomalies in major ion concentrations in water from one of these monitoring wells, provide additional evidence of impact to USDWs and indicate upward solute migration to depths of current groundwater use. Detections of diesel range organics and other organic compounds in domestic wells <600 m from unlined pits used prior to the mid-1990s to dispose diesel-fuel based drilling mud and production fluids suggest impact to domestic wells as a result of legacy pit disposal practices.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"50","issue":"8","pages":"4524-4536","date":"April 19, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

For example, groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and spillage of brine and other gas drilling-related fluids is known to occur. However, contamination of shallow potable aquifers by HVHF at depth has never been fully documented. We investigated a case where Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania caused inundation of natural gas and foam in initially potable groundwater used by several households. With comprehensive 2D gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), an unresolved complex mixture of organic compounds was identified in the aquifer. Similar signatures were also observed in flowback from Marcellus Shale gas wells. A compound identified in flowback, 2-n-Butoxyethanol, was also positively identified in one of the foaming drinking water wells at nanogram-per-liter concentrations. The most likely explanation of the incident is that stray natural gas and drilling or HF compounds were driven ∼1–3 km along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the aquifer used as a potable water source. Part of the problem may have been wastewaters from a pit leak reported at the nearest gas well pad—the only nearby pad where wells were hydraulically fractured before the contamination incident. If samples of drilling, pit, and HVHF fluids had been available, GCxGC-TOFMS might have fingerprinted the contamination source. Such evaluations would contribute significantly to better management practices as the shale gas industry expands worldwide.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"112","issue":"20","pages":"6325-6330","date":"2015/05/19","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1420279112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6325","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:47:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 25941400","tags":[{"tag":"Marcellus Shale","type":1},{"tag":"high-volume hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"water quality","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:47:15Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:47:22Z"}},{"key":"93MCYHHH","version":2443,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/93MCYHHH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/93MCYHHH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kharaka et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kharaka, Yousif K., James J.

Petroleum production, drilling operations, and improperly sealed abandoned wells have caused significant local groundwater contamination in many states, including at the USGS OSPER sites in Oklahoma. The potential for groundwater contamination is higher when producing natural gas and oil from unconventional sources of energy, including shale and tight sandstones. These reservoirs require horizontally-completed wells and massive hydraulic fracturing that injects large volumes (up to 50,000 m3/well) of high-pressured water with added proppant, and toxic organic and inorganic chemicals. Recent results show that flow back and produced waters from Haynesville (Texas) and Marcellus (Pennsylvania) Shale have high salinities (≥200,000 mg/L TDS) and high NORMs (up to 10,000 picocuries/L) concentrations. A major research effort is needed worldwide to minimize all potential environmental impacts, especially groundwater contamination and induced seismicity, when producing these extremely important new sources of energy.","publicationTitle":"Procedia Earth and Planetary Science","volume":"7","issue":"","pages":"422","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.proeps.2013.03.132","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Energy-Water Nexus","url":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157331","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:45:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"pubs.er.usgs.gov","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:45:38Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:45:40Z"}},{"key":"8A57IA8X","version":3301,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8A57IA8X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8A57IA8X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Konschnik and Boling","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Konschnik, Katherine E., and Mark K.

Regulators face a rapidly changing industry comprised of hundreds of players, operating tens of thousands of wells across 30 states. They are often challenged to respond by budget cuts, a brain drain to industry, regulations designed for conventional gas developments, insuﬃcient information, and deeply polarized debates about hydraulic fracturing and its regulation. As a result, shale gas governance remains a halting patchwork of rules, undermining opportunities to eﬀectively characterize and mitigate development risk.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8404-8416","date":"2014-08-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/es405377u","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"Shale Gas Development","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es405377u","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:42:37Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["DYDM6CNJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:42:37Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:42:40Z"}},{"key":"CEQTJSWB","version":2420,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CEQTJSWB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CEQTJSWB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"King and King","parsedDate":"2013-09-30","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">King, George Everette, and Daniel E.

Will these communities be cursed with lower long run incomes in the wake of the boom? We study the oil boom-and-bust cycle of the 1970s and 1980s to gain insights. Using annual data on drilling to identify western boom-and-bust counties, we find substantial positive local employment and income effects during the boom. In the aftermath of the bust, however, we find that incomes per capita decreased and unemployment compensation payments increased relative to what they would have been if the boom had not occurred.This article is protected by copyright.

Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are ∼2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 ± 3% of national emissions. The spatial patterns of our emission fluxes and observed methane–propane correlations indicate that fossil fuel extraction and refining are major contributors (45 ± 13%) in the south-central United States. This result suggests that regional methane emissions due to fossil fuel extraction and processing could be 4.9 ± 2.6 times larger than in EDGAR, the most comprehensive global methane inventory. These results cast doubt on the US EPA’s recent decision to downscale its estimate of national natural gas emissions by 25–30%. Overall, we conclude that methane emissions associated with both the animal husbandry and fossil fuel industries have larger greenhouse gas impacts than indicated by existing inventories.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"201314392","date":"2013/11/21","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1314392110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314392110","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:08:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 24277804","tags":[{"tag":"climate change policy","type":1},{"tag":"geostatistical inverse modeling","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:08:47Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:08:59Z"}},{"key":"FMBHUN7W","version":2383,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FMBHUN7W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FMBHUN7W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kansal","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kansal, Tushar. &#x201C;Regulation of Shale Gas Development&#x202F;: An Argument for State Preeminence with Federal Support,&#x201D; 2012. https://core.ac.uk/display/10129482.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FMBHUN7W","version":2383,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Regulation of shale gas development : an argument for state preeminence with federal support","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Kansal"}],"abstractNote":"Shale gas development has become big business in the United States during the past decade, introducing drilling to parts of the country that have not seen it in decades and provoking an accelerating shift in the country's energy profile. State governments, which have historically regulated the oil and gas industry and continue to do so today, were in many cases caught by surprise by the speed and the scale of the shale gas boom and are still trying to update and adapt their regulatory practices to respond to the impacts that shale gas development is causing in communities in their states. In some instances, these impacts have included groundwater and surface water contamination, air pollution, exploded homes, and damage to wetlands and other habitats, among other impacts. Shale gas development has also created jobs, brought economic development to distressed communities, lowered fuel costs, and has begun to supplant coal in the nation's electricity supply. The thesis seeks to understand whether primary regulatory authority over shale gas development should rest with the states or with the federal government. In answering this question, the author applies theory from the field of regulatory federalism to the practice of shale gas development to ascertain whether the federal government or state governments are best suited to regulate shale gas development. Grounding the analysis in both regulations as-written and as-applied in a number of states that have active shale gas industries, the author uses four key criteria to gauge whether regulatory authority should rest with the central government or with the states. These four criteria are: the geographic distribution of costs and benefits associated with shale gas development; regulatory capacity at the federal level and at the state level; which level can better foster innovation, flexibility, and adaptability; and which level can better provide efficiency, certainty, and stability. The analysis finds that, in most cases, states are better situated than the federal government to regulate shale gas development on the basis of each of the four criteria. The author also subjects current regulatory practice to a two-part test to determine whether regulatory failure is currently occurring that would compel the federal government to assume regulatory authority. The results from this test are negative. The author concludes that primary regulatory authority over shale gas development should remain with state governments. Finally, the author provides four policy recommendations, two each to state governments and to the federal government, to improve regulatory practice and outcomes in the future.by Tushar Kansal.Thesis (M.C.P.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2012.Cataloged from PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 106-118)","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en-gb","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Regulation of shale gas development","url":"https://core.ac.uk/display/10129482","accessDate":"2018-08-01T18:07:25Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"core.ac.uk","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T18:07:25Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T18:07:33Z"}},{"key":"XIWRIIKF","version":2377,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XIWRIIKF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XIWRIIKF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Caulton et al.","parsedDate":"2014-04-29","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Caulton, D.

This study assesses the composition of these flowback waters from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania, USA. Concentrations of most inorganic components of flowback water (Cl, Br, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba, Ra, Fe, Mn, total dissolved solids, and others) increase with time from a well after hydraulic stimulation. Based on results in several datasets reported here, the greatest concentration of Cl− in flowback water is 151,000mg/L. For total Ra (combined 226Ra and 228Ra) in flowback, the highest level reported is 6540pCi/L. Flowback waters from hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus wells resemble brines produced from conventional gas wells that tap into other Paleozoic formations in the region. The Br/Cl ratio and other parameters indicate that both types of brine formed by the evaporation of seawater followed by dolomitization, sulfate reduction and subsurface mixing with seawater and/or freshwater. Trends and relationships in brine composition indicate that (1) increased salt concentration in flowback is not mainly caused by dissolution of salt or other minerals in rock units, (2) the flowback waters represent a mixture of injection waters with highly concentrated in situ brines similar to those in the other formations, and (3) these waters contain concentrations of Ra and Ba that are commonly hundreds of times the US drinking water standards.","publicationTitle":"Applied Geochemistry","volume":"28","issue":"","pages":"55-61","date":"January 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Geochemistry","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2012.10.002","ISSN":"0883-2927","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292712002752","accessDate":"2018-08-01T17:58:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T17:58:59Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T17:59:06Z"}},{"key":"TFIBN6P3","version":2931,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TFIBN6P3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TFIBN6P3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yacovitch et al.","parsedDate":"2018-08-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yacovitch, Tara I., Bruno Neininger, Scott C.

The δ13CH4 signatures (mean = −42.8‰ ± 1.3‰ s.e.; n = 32) strongly indicate a fossil fuel source rather than a biogenic source for most of the leaks; natural gas sampled across the city had average δ13CH4 values of −36.8‰ (±0.7‰ s.e., n = 10), whereas CH4 collected from landfill sites, wetlands, and sewer systems had δ13CH4 signatures ∼20‰ lighter (μ = −57.8‰, ±1.6‰ s.e., n = 8).

In the next 20 years, tens of thousands of new gas wells will be drilled into the Marcellus, Utica, and Upper Devonian shale formations of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania currently requires production companies to post a bond to ensure environmental reclamation of abandoned well sites, but the size of the bond covers only a small fraction of the site reclamation costs. The economics of shale gas development favor transfer of assets from large entities to smaller ones. With the assets go the liabilities, and without a mechanism to prevent the new owners from assuming reclamation liabilities beyond their means, the economics favor default on well-plugging and site restoration obligations.

Natural gas leaks are also the largest anthropogenic source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in the U.S. To reduce pipeline leakage and increase consumer safety, we deployed a Picarro G2301 Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer in a car, mapping 5893 natural gas leaks (2.5 to 88.6 ppm CH4) across 1500 road miles of Washington, DC. The δ13C-isotopic signatures of the methane (−38.2‰ ± 3.9‰ s.d.) and ethane (−36.5 ± 1.1 s.d.) and the CH4:C2H6 ratios (25.5 ± 8.9 s.d.) closely matched the pipeline gas (−39.0‰ and −36.2‰ for methane and ethane; 19.0 for CH4/C2H6). Emissions from four street leaks ranged from 9200 to 38 200 L CH4 day–1 each, comparable to natural gas used by 1.7 to 7.0 homes, respectively. At 19 tested locations, 12 potentially explosive (Grade 1) methane concentrations of 50 000 to 500 000 ppm were detected in manholes.

In addition, fresh water scarcity in dry regions or during periods of drought could limit shale gas development. This paper explores the possibility of using alternative water sources and their impact on NORM levels through blending acid mine drainage (AMD) eﬄuent with recycled hydraulic fracturing ﬂowback ﬂuids (HFFFs). We conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which the chemistry and NORM of diﬀerent mix proportions of AMD and HFFF were examined after reacting for 48 h. The experimental data combined with geochemical modeling and X-ray diﬀraction analysis suggest that several ions, including sulfate, iron, barium, strontium, and a large portion of radium (60− 100%), precipitated into newly formed solids composed mainly of Sr barite within the ﬁrst ∼10 h of mixing. The results imply that blending AMD and HFFF could be an eﬀective management practice for both remediation of the high NORM in the Marcellus HFFF wastewater and beneﬁcial utilization of AMD that is currently contaminating waterways in northeastern U.S.A.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"2","pages":"1334-1342","date":"2014-01-21","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/es403852h","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es403852h","accessDate":"2018-08-01T15:20:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T15:20:06Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T15:20:06Z"}},{"key":"WYH34ZW2","version":2338,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WYH34ZW2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WYH34ZW2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cueto-Felgueroso and Juanes","parsedDate":"2013-12-03","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis, and Ruben Juanes. &#x201C;Forecasting Long-Term Gas Production from Shale.&#x201D; <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> 110, no. 49 (December 3, 2013): 19660&#x2013;61. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319578110.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WYH34ZW2","version":2338,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Forecasting long-term gas production from shale","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Cueto-Felgueroso"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Juanes"}],"abstractNote":"Oil and natural gas from deep shale formations are transforming the United States economy and its energy outlook. Back in 2005, the US Energy Information Administration published projections of United States natural gas supply that stressed the need to develop an import infrastructure (1): by 2025, imports would account for almost one-third of United States consumption. When we compare those forecasts with the current ones to 2040 (Fig. 1) (2), it is inevitable to feel that a disruptive technology has emerged since. Natural gas consumption is expected to increase significantly over the next three decades, with strong demand growth from the electricity generation and industrial sectors. However, the United States will probably become a net exporter of gas before 2020, increasing domestic production by 44% over the projection period.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. \nNatural gas production in the United States, by source (in trillion cubic feet per year).

Although much discussion has centered on the need for new energy technologies, this debate as yet has been narrow and limited. Meaningful deployment of any technology will raise questions of public acceptance. Little is known about how diverse publics in the United States will respond to the advent of new energy sources, whether they involve a “second renaissance” for nuclear power, a dash to embrace hydraulic fracking for oil and natural gas, or emerging prospects for renewable energies like wind and solar power. Yet public acceptance will determine the outlook. Adding further complication is the growing debate about traditional energy sources and the extent to which a fossil fuel–based energy system should continue to be central to the American economy. This essay explores the issues involved in public acceptance of stability and change in the U.S. energy system. We conclude with several recommendations for gaining a greater understanding of the public acceptance quandary.","publicationTitle":"Daedalus","volume":"142","issue":"1","pages":"90-96","date":"01/2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1162/DAED_a_00187","ISSN":"0011-5266, 1548-6192","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/DAED_a_00187","accessDate":"2018-08-01T15:05:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-01T15:05:49Z","dateModified":"2018-08-01T15:05:52Z"}},{"key":"K83Q25XN","version":2316,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/K83Q25XN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/K83Q25XN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cotton","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cotton, Matthew. &#x201C;NIMBY or Not?

Studies of how policy can best react to these challenges and how it can balance risk and reward have focused on prescriptive regulatory responses and, to a somewhat lesser extent, voluntary industry best practices. While there is undoubtedly room for improved regulation, innovative tools are relatively understudied. The liability system predates environmental regulation yet still plays an important—and in some senses predominant—role. Changes to that system, including burden-shifting rules and increased bond requirements, might improve outcomes. Similarly, new regulation can and should incorporate modern understanding of the benefits of market-based approaches. Information disclosure requirements can benefit the liability system and have independent benefits of their own. Policymakers faced with a need for policy change in reaction to shale development should carefully consider alternatives to regulation and, when regulation is deemed necessary, consider which tool is best suited.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2432194","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2432194","accessDate":"2018-07-31T20:07:14Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T20:07:14Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T20:07:15Z"}},{"key":"TY9P9TFT","version":2290,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TY9P9TFT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TY9P9TFT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Baker and Passmore","parsedDate":"2010-09-13","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Baker, Rose M., and David Passmore. &#x201C;Benchmarks for Assessing the Potential Impact of a Natural Gas Severance Tax on the Pennsylvania Economy.&#x201D; SSRN Scholarly Paper.

However, the Marcellus Shale development opportunity also has generated controversy about its potential environmental, safety, and health impacts.  Whether to impose a severance tax on natural gas produced - and the structure, rate, and exemptions for such a tax - has been a focus of vigorous legislative and public attention and debate. A number of severance tax proposals have been offered. The potential impact of a natural gas severance tax on the Pennsylvania economy has received slight analytical attention, even though the Pennsylvania General Assembly intended to enact a natural gas severance tax by October 1, 2010.  The research reported in this document was designed to estimate the magnitude of the impact on the Pennsylvania economy of a Pennsylvania natural gas severance tax. We benchmarked the impact of every $100 million of revenue collected from a natural gas severance tax between 2011 and 2015 jobs, business sales, income, and population in Pennsylvania. Of course, what is revenue for the Commonwealth is, at the same time, a production cost for Pennsylvania gas producers. For this reason, we treated the revenue collected as a production cost that gas producers cannot pass along to customers. Also, some yet-to-be-decided plan will allocate revenue collected to state government and to local county and municipal governments. Therefore, we also considered the economic consequences for Pennsylvania of spending the severance tax revenue collected under various spending plans.  Severance tax and revenue spending plans that actually have been proposed are not evaluated in our analysis because the revenue yield and spending distribution for each plan have not been specified completely by their proponents. The revenue yields from each plan are dependent on the volume and price of gas extracted, which are factors that are exogenous to any tax structure and rate plan. The spending distribution plans will evolve through fiscal and political negotiation. As a consequence of these information constraints, we chose to benchmark the impact of every $100 million in severance tax revenue collected - treated in our analysis as $100 million of production costs for the Pennsylvania oil and gas industry - on the Pennsylvania economy. In addition, our benchmarks take into account the potential impacts of distributing each $100 million of revenue through state and local spending and through deferring spending by saving some revenue to mitigate environmental, safety, and health problems that might occur in the future. In this way, we seek to provide a yardstick by which various tax and spending plans can be measured.  The REMI Policy Insight model was applied to simulate the outcomes of various scenarios that describe the potential economic and demographic impacts of each $100 million of severance tax collected, along with the current and deferred spending of these tax revenues by state and local authorities. We found that each $100 million of production costs added to the Pennsylvania oil and gas industry from 2011 through 2015 could generate a small impact on Pennsylvania’s economy and demography. Also, each $100 million of spending by state and local governments, even if some is deferred, potentially more than makes up for any losses resulting from each additional $100 million of production costs imposed by a severance tax. The benchmarks for the potential impact of a severance tax on the Pennsylvania economy are subject to numerous cautions, constraints, and uncertainties, some of which are discussed in this report.   The report ends with an open invitation to civil dialogue about the potential impacts of a severance tax using an online discussion forum and social bookmarking tools. This conversation is started in this report with critical comments from two independent reviewers about our estimates of the potential economic and demographic impacts of a severance tax on natural gas extraction.  Our main conclusion is that a severance tax on natural gas extraction in Pennsylvania would increase costs for gas drilling companies, but spending the resulting increase in state revenue generated by the tax could yield positive, but small, impacts on the state’s economy and population.

Estimates of gas production from these formations have mainly relied on formulas designed for wells with a different geometry. We consider the simplest model of gas production consistent with the basic physics and geometry of the extraction process. In principle, solutions of the model depend upon many parameters, but in practice and within a given gas field, all but two can be fixed at typical values, leading to a nonlinear diffusion problem we solve exactly with a scaling curve. The scaling curve production rate declines as 1 over the square root of time early on, and it later declines exponentially. This simple model provides a surprisingly accurate description of gas extraction from 8,294 wells in the United States’ oldest shale play, the Barnett Shale. There is good agreement with the scaling theory for 2,057 horizontal wells in which production started to decline exponentially in less than 10 y. The remaining 6,237 horizontal wells in our analysis are too young for us to predict when exponential decline will set in, but the model can nevertheless be used to establish lower and upper bounds on well lifetime. Finally, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the gas that will be produced by the wells in our sample, individually and in total. The estimated ultimate recovery from our sample of 8,294 wells is between 10 and 20 trillion standard cubic feet.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","issue":"49","pages":"19731-19736","date":"2013/12/03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1313380110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/49/19731","accessDate":"2018-07-31T19:23:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

Since 2000, however, the proportion of LNG-traded spot or under short-term contracts has grown substantially, while long-term contracts have become more flexible. While long-term contracts increase the debt capacity of large, long-lived, capital investments by reducing cash flow variability, they also may limit the ability of the contracting parties to take advantage of profitable ephemeral trading opportunities. After developing a model that illustrates these trade-offs, we argue that increased LNG market liquidity resulting from a number of exogenous changes is likely to encourage much greater volume and destination flexibility in contracts and increased reliance on short-term and spot market trades. These changes would, in turn, reinforce the initial increase in market liquidity.","publicationTitle":"The Energy Journal","volume":"Volume 36","issue":"Number 3","pages":"","date":"2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/a/aen/journl/ej36-3-hartley.html","accessDate":"2018-07-31T19:07:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ideas.repec.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T19:07:20Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T19:07:30Z"}},{"key":"ZMVACMH6","version":2250,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZMVACMH6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZMVACMH6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jordaan et al.","parsedDate":"2013-11-05","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jordaan, Sarah M., Laura Diaz Anadon, Erik Mielke, and Daniel P.

Although greenhouse gas emissions have played a role in shaping the RFS, water implications are less understood. We demonstrate a spatial, life cycle approach to estimate water consumption of transportation fuel scenarios, including a comparison to current water withdrawals and drought incidence by state. The water consumption and land footprint of six scenarios are compared to the RFS, including shale oil, coal-to-liquids, shale gas-to-liquids, corn ethanol, and cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass. The corn scenario is the most water and land intense option and is weighted toward drought-prone states. Fossil options and cellulosic ethanol require significantly less water and are weighted toward less drought-prone states. Coal-to-liquids is an exception, where water consumption is partially weighted toward drought-prone states. Results suggest that there may be considerable water and land impacts associated with meeting energy security goals through using only biofuels. Ultimately, water and land requirements may constrain energy security goals without careful planning, indicating that there is a need to better balance trade-offs. Our approach provides policymakers with a method to integrate federal policies with regional planning over various temporal and spatial scales.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"21","pages":"11976-11984","date":"November 5, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Many shale plays are located in areas more visible to the general public than ever before in the history of domestic onshore oil and gas field development. Shale play development for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, has therefore resulted in increased scrutiny by agencies causing successful operators to be more proactive in the siting of wells and associated field infrastructure including access roads, flowlines, and gathering systems. Complex regulatory regimes must be navigated by producers and operators in each shale play and, although operating under standardized Federal regulations, are required to address the preferences of each regulatory agency, and in many cases, individual regulators themselves.","date":"2013","proceedingsTitle":"","conferenceName":"","place":"","publisher":"Society of Petroleum Engineers","volume":"","pages":"","series":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2118/163804-MS","ISBN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.onepetro.org/doi/10.2118/163804-MS","accessDate":"2018-07-31T18:49:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T18:49:40Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T18:49:42Z"}},{"key":"QESVP23P","version":2235,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QESVP23P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QESVP23P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Blauch et al.","parsedDate":"2009-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Blauch, Matthew Eric, Roger R.

In Pennsylvania, oil and gas wastewater is sometimes treated at brine treatment facilities and discharged to local streams. This study examined the water quality and isotopic compositions of discharged effluents, surface waters, and stream sediments associated with a treatment facility site in western Pennsylvania. The elevated levels of chloride and bromide, combined with the strontium, radium, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the effluents reflect the composition of Marcellus Shale produced waters. The discharge of the effluent from the treatment facility increased downstream concentrations of chloride and bromide above background levels. Barium and radium were substantially (>90%) reduced in the treated effluents compared to concentrations in Marcellus Shale produced waters. Nonetheless, 226Ra levels in stream sediments (544–8759 Bq/kg) at the point of discharge were ∼200 times greater than upstream and background sediments (22–44 Bq/kg) and above radioactive waste disposal threshold regulations, posing potential environmental risks of radium bioaccumulation in localized areas of shale gas wastewater disposal.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"20","pages":"11849-11857","date":"October 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The influences are evaluated using two groups of variables characterizing hazard effects and amenity effects. A spatial error model was employed to capture the spatial dependence between neighbouring properties. The results show that property values are negatively correlated with the number of sour gas wells and flaring oil batteries within 4km of the property. Indices reflecting health hazards associated with potential rates of H2S release (based on information from Emergency Response Plans and Zones) also have a significant negative association with property prices. The findings suggest that oil and sour gas facilities located within 4km of rural residential properties significantly affect their sale price.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"27","issue":"3","pages":"248-269","date":"October 1, 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Resource and Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.reseneeco.2004.11.003","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"The impact of oil and natural gas facilities on rural residential property values","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765505000084","accessDate":"2018-07-31T04:46:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hedonic prices","type":1},{"tag":"Property value impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Sour gas","type":1}],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T04:46:13Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T04:46:45Z"}},{"key":"DXECD5HP","version":2208,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DXECD5HP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DXECD5HP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bearer et al.","parsedDate":"2012-12","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bearer, Scott, Emily Nicholas, Tamara Gagnolet, Michele DePhilip, Tara Moberg, and Nels Johnson. &#x201C;ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND CASE STUDIES: Evaluating the Scientific Support of Conservation Best Management Practices for Shale Gas Extraction in the Appalachian Basin.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Practice</i> 14, no. 4 (December 2012): 308&#x2013;19. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1466046612000385.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DXECD5HP","version":2208,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND CASE STUDIES: Evaluating the Scientific Support of Conservation Best Management Practices for Shale Gas Extraction in the Appalachian Basin","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Bearer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Nicholas"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Gagnolet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michele","lastName":"DePhilip"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Moberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nels","lastName":"Johnson"}],"abstractNote":"Extensive shale gas development is expected throughout the Appalachian Basin, and implementing effective avoidance and mitigation techniques to reduce ecosystem impacts is essential. Adoption of best management practices (BMPs) is an important approach for standardizing these techniques. For BMPs to be credible and effective, they need to be strongly supported by science. We focused on 28 BMPs related to surface impacts to habitat and wildlife and tested whether each practice was supported in the scientific literature. Our quantitative assessment produced four general conclusions: (1) the vast majority of BMPs are broad in nature, which provides flexibility in implementation, but the lack of site-specific details may hamper effectiveness and potential for successful conservation outcomes; (2) relatively low support scores were calculated for a number of BMPs, most notably those relating to noise and light pollution, due to existing research documenting effects on behavior rather than directly on species' survival and fitness—an indication that more research is needed; (3) the most commonly and strongly supported BMPs include landscape-level planning and shared infrastructure; avoidance of sensitive areas, aquatic habitats, and core forest areas; and road design, location, and maintenance; and (4) actions to enhance the development and implementation of BMPs should include public education, increased communication among scientists, improved data sharing, development of site-specific BMPs that focus on achieving ecological outcomes, and more industry collaboration.Environmental Practice 14:308–319 (2012)","publicationTitle":"Environmental Practice","volume":"14","issue":"4","pages":"308-319","date":"2012/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1017/S1466046612000385","ISSN":"1466-0466, 1466-0474","shortTitle":"ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND CASE STUDIES","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-practice/article/environmental-reviews-and-case-studies-evaluating-the-scientific-support-of-conservation-best-management-practices-for-shale-gas-extraction-in-the-appalachian-basin/D185437113A6113482A0973BC17DD240","accessDate":"2018-07-31T04:40:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge Core","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T04:40:53Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T04:41:06Z"}},{"key":"DDIPZFBH","version":3498,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/DDIPZFBH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/DDIPZFBH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Christopherson and Rightor","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Christopherson, Susan, and Ned Rightor. &#x201C;How Shale Gas Extraction Affects Drilling Localities: Lessons for Regional and City Policy Makers.&#x201D; <i>City Management</i> 2 (2012): 20.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"DDIPZFBH","version":3498,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"How shale gas extraction affects drilling localities: Lessons for regional and city policy makers","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Christopherson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ned","lastName":"Rightor"}],"abstractNote":"In countries around the world, the public debate over the prospect of high volume hydraulic fracturing for shale gas has revolved around its environmental impacts, while taking as a given that exploitation of this newly available natural gas asset will produce significant economic benefits for local and regional economies. In this paper the authors use multiple methods, including a case study of the Marcellus Shale gas ‘play’ in the USA, to examine how the economic costs and benefits of high volume hydraulic fracturing have been assessed. They argue that the economic impact models, which have been used to project potential benefits and job creation, provide only a fraction of the information needed to understand the consequences of drilling for the regions in which it occurs. The paper also examines some of the challenges local communities face in responding to the costs posed by shale gas extraction. The authors’ analysis indicates that, while shale gas development may increase jobs and tax revenues in the predominantly rural regions where drilling occurs, it can also impose significant short- and long-term costs. To fully assess the economic effects of hydraulic fracturing, local and regional policy makers need to understand the boom-bust cycle that characterises natural gas development. This cycle has implications for local costs and benefits short term, and for the longer-term economic development prospects of localities in drilling regions.","publicationTitle":"City Management","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"20","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T04:38:49Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T04:38:50Z"}},{"key":"ML3SYJRB","version":2202,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ML3SYJRB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ML3SYJRB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barth","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Barth, Jannette M. &#x201C;The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development on State and Local Economies: Benefits, Costs, and Uncertainties.&#x201D; <i>NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy</i> 23, no. 1 (2013): 85&#x2013;101. https://doi.org/10.2190/NS.23.1.f.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"ML3SYJRB","version":2202,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development on State and Local Economies: Benefits, Costs, and Uncertainties","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jannette M.","lastName":"Barth"}],"abstractNote":"It is often assumed that natural gas exploration and development in the Marcellus Shale will bring great economic prosperity to state and local economies.

This work expands on these studies by estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in consumptive water use in Texas river basins during a period of rapid shale gas development and use in electricity generation from August 2008 through December 2009. While water consumption decreased in Texas overall, some river basins saw increased water consumption and others saw decreased water consumption, depending on the extent of extraction activity in the basin, the mix of power plants using cooling water in that basin, and price-based changes in the power sector. Due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the consumptive water impacts of natural gas development and use in the power sector, local and regional water use impacts must also be considered in addition to the overall supply chain impacts.","publicationTitle":"ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering","volume":"2","issue":"8","pages":"2028-2035","date":"2014-08-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/sc500236g","ISSN":"2168-0485, 2168-0485","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/sc500236g","accessDate":"2018-07-31T04:35:24Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-31T04:35:24Z","dateModified":"2018-07-31T04:35:29Z"}},{"key":"59E3N5YN","version":2192,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/59E3N5YN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/59E3N5YN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Shaffer et al.","parsedDate":"2013-09-03","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Shaffer, Devin L., Laura H.

We review the current state of practice for produced water management across the United States and discuss the interrelated regulatory, infrastructure, and economic drivers for produced water reuse. Within this framework, we examine the Marcellus shale play, a region in the eastern United States where produced water is currently reused without desalination. In the Marcellus region, and in other shale plays worldwide with similar constraints, contraction of current reuse opportunities within the shale gas industry and growing restrictions on produced water disposal will provide strong incentives for produced water desalination for reuse outside the industry. The most challenging scenarios for the selection of desalination for reuse over other management strategies will be those involving high-salinity produced water, which must be desalinated with thermal separation processes. We explore desalination technologies for treatment of high-salinity shale gas produced water, and we critically review mechanical vapor compression (MVC), membrane distillation (MD), and forward osmosis (FO) as the technologies best suited for desalination of high-salinity produced water for reuse outside the shale gas industry. The advantages and challenges of applying MVC, MD, and FO technologies to produced water desalination are discussed, and directions for future research and development are identified. We find that desalination for reuse of produced water is technically feasible and can be economically relevant. However, because produced water management is primarily an economic decision, expanding desalination for reuse is dependent on process and material improvements to reduce capital and operating costs.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"17","pages":"9569-9583","date":"September 3, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The study is unique in its use of transient linear drainage production profiles that match the physics of the system and fit the production history in the Barnett very well. Average low Btu wells in the top two tiers are viable at $4/MMBtu, whereas average high Btu wells in the same tiers are economic at $2/MMBtu. Dry gas wells are the most sensitive to fluctuations in the price of natural gas whereas high Btu wells are also sensitive to the prices of oil and natural gas liquids. There is a distribution of productivity within each tier, with better wells requiring a much lower price to be viable than the average well. The granular subdivision of productivity, low versus high Btu, and intra-tier quality variation help to explain historical drilling patterns and also allow us to predict future development patterns in the field accurately as demonstrated for 2011 and 2012 in Browning et al.

Moderate support was found for the hypothesis that individuals residing in places with diverse levels of energy development exhibit dissimilar perceptions of the energy industry. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicate that residents of the county where the natural gas industry is more mature (Wise County) exhibit somewhat more negative perceptions of the energy industry than do residents of the county where natural gas industry is less established (Johnson County). The results also reveal that mineral rights ownership is a relatively strong and consistent factor associated with public perception of the natural gas industry.

While most of the media attention has been focused on the conflicts in states like Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, and Colorado, the discovery of huge natural gas reserves in the Haynesville Shale formation in 2008 set off a drilling rush that has resulted in differential benefits and risks for various residents. Drawing on current research and extensive interview data collected from a relevant cross-section of community stakeholders, this study offers a descriptive and comparative analysis of the types of benefits and opportunities perceived to accompany increased unconventional natural gas development, the range of perceived negative impacts and threats associated with such development, and the extent to which respondents viewed the benefits of the Haynesville boom as outweighing the costs. While most stakeholders perceived that natural gas development offered the community a host of positive socioeconomic benefits in the form of increased jobs, tax revenues, services, and new economic opportunities for local businesses and landowners, a substantial minority of residents also associated shale development with a larger number of negative social, economic, and environmental impacts. Those included the degradation of water resources; increased road damage, noise, and traffic accidents; and other assorted threats to public health, animals, and the rural landscape. Moreover, while most Haynesville residents believed that the socioeconomic benefits of development had outweighed the collective socioeconomic/environmental costs to the region, a substantial minority of respondents was also skeptical or disagreed that the benefits to date had been worth the risks. These findings both support and extend existing sociological research in several key respects. The implications of the study, both for the region and the national debate over fracking, are discussed.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"34","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-30T22:32:18Z","dateModified":"2018-07-30T22:32:18Z"}},{"key":"FCQAA9YD","version":2154,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FCQAA9YD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FCQAA9YD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Theodori","parsedDate":"2013-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Theodori, Gene. &#x201C;Perception of the Natural Gas Industry and Engagement in Individual Civic Actions.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Rural Social Sciences</i> 28 (January 1, 2013): 122&#x2013;34.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FCQAA9YD","version":2154,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Perception of the natural gas industry and engagement in individual civic actions","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gene","lastName":"Theodori"}],"abstractNote":"Data collected in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals in Tarrant County, Texas, were used to empirically examine issues associated with public perception of the natural gas industry. Further, the associations of public perception of the energy industry with individual actions that (a) may or may not have been taken and/or (b) may or may not be taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas were investigated. Echoing findings from research in two neighboring Barnett Shale counties (Theodori 2009), members of the public in Tarrant County appear to dislike certain potentially problematic social and/or environmental issues perceived to accompany natural gas development. Conversely, these same Tarrant County residents view less negatively the economic and/or service-related benefits that often result from such development. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that the social/environmental perceptual variable is a key factor in explaining past behaviors and predicting future behaviors taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas.

Symptoms of health impacts and sources of psychological stress were coded. Symptom and stressor counts were quantified for each interview. The counts for each participant were compared longitudinally.Results: Participants attributed 59 unique health impacts and 13 stressors to Marcellus Shale development. Stress was the most frequently-reported symptom. Over time, perceived health impacts increased (P = 0·042), while stressors remained constant (P = 0·855).Discussion: Exposure-based epidemiological studies are needed to address identified health impacts and those that may develop as unconventional natural gas extraction continues. Many of the stressors can be addressed immediately.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"104-112","date":"June 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1179/2049396713Y.0000000024","ISSN":"1077-3525","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1179/2049396713Y.0000000024","accessDate":"2018-07-30T20:38:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23684268","tags":[{"tag":"Community impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental health","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Health impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Health perceptions","type":1},{"tag":"High volume","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Marcellus shale","type":1},{"tag":"Mental health","type":1},{"tag":"NGD","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Public health","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Social impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Stressors","type":1},{"tag":"Symptoms","type":1},{"tag":"UNGD","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional natural gas development","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-30T20:38:38Z","dateModified":"2018-07-30T20:39:21Z"}},{"key":"YJY2ATKB","version":2127,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YJY2ATKB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YJY2ATKB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Browning et al.","parsedDate":"2013-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Browning, John, Scott W.

This work reports direct measurements of methane emissions at 190 onshore natural gas sites in the United States (150 production sites, 27 well completion flowbacks, 9 well unloadings, and 4 workovers). For well completion flowbacks, which clear fractured wells of liquid to allow gas production, methane emissions ranged from 0.01 Mg to 17 Mg (mean = 1.7 Mg; 95% confidence bounds of 0.67–3.3 Mg), compared with an average of 81 Mg per event in the 2011 EPA national emission inventory from April 2013. Emission factors for pneumatic pumps and controllers as well as equipment leaks were both comparable to and higher than estimates in the national inventory. Overall, if emission factors from this work for completion flowbacks, equipment leaks, and pneumatic pumps and controllers are assumed to be representative of national populations and are used to estimate national emissions, total annual emissions from these source categories are calculated to be 957 Gg of methane (with sampling and measurement uncertainties estimated at ±200 Gg). The estimate for comparable source categories in the EPA national inventory is ∼1,200 Gg. Additional measurements of unloadings and workovers are needed to produce national emission estimates for these source categories. The 957 Gg in emissions for completion flowbacks, pneumatics, and equipment leaks, coupled with EPA national inventory estimates for other categories, leads to an estimated 2,300 Gg of methane emissions from natural gas production (0.42% of gross gas production).\nAuthor Information\nDavid T.

During impoundment, microbial activity can alter the fate of metals including radionuclides, give rise to odorous compounds, and result in biocorrosion that complicates water and waste management and increases production costs. Here, we describe the microbial ecology at multiple depths of three flowback impoundments from the Marcellus shale that were managed differently. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed that bacterial communities in the untreated and biocide-amended impoundments were depth dependent, diverse, and most similar to species within the taxa γ-proteobacteria, α-proteobacteria, δ-proteobacteria, Clostridia, Synergistetes, Thermotogae, Spirochetes, and Bacteroidetes. The bacterial community in the pretreated and aerated impoundment was uniform with depth, less diverse, and most similar to known iodide-oxidizing bacteria in the α-proteobacteria. Archaea were identified only in the untreated and biocide-amended impoundments and were affiliated to the Methanomicrobia class. This is the first study of microbial communities in flowback water impoundments from hydraulic fracturing. The findings expand our knowledge of microbial diversity of an emergent and unexplored environment and may guide the management of flowback impoundments.","publicationTitle":"FEMS Microbiology Ecology","volume":"86","issue":"3","pages":"567-580","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/1574-6941.12183","ISSN":"1574-6941","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1574-6941.12183","accessDate":"2018-07-30T16:18:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Theoretical considerations support this relationship to be the result of bacterial transformation of CO2 to methane and is therefore indicative of the biogenic origin of methane. Thermogenic gases with high C2+ concentrations (wet gases associated with crude oil) have D/H ratios from −260 to −150%. with deuterium contents tending to increase with decreasing wetness. Dry gases which are not associated with petroleum are more enriched in deuterium (−180 to −130%.) and show an increase in deuterium with increasing rank of the source beds as it is similarly known for carbon-13. Many dry gases in young sedimentary basins were found to contain significant amounts of C2+ hydrocarbons. These gases cannot be grouped with either the biogenic or thermogenic gases and their methane is concluded to be of mixed biogenic and thermochemical origin. Using a δ13CδD diagrammatic display of the isotope data of methanes the various genetic groups of natural gases can be defined more clearly.","publicationTitle":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","volume":"44","issue":"5","pages":"649-661","date":"May 1, 1980","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/0016-7037(80)90155-6","ISSN":"0016-7037","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703780901556","accessDate":"2018-07-30T15:56:25Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-30T15:56:25Z","dateModified":"2018-07-30T15:57:02Z"}},{"key":"2XFMML84","version":2082,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2XFMML84","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2XFMML84","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Muehlenbachs et al.","parsedDate":"2013-03-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Muehlenbachs, Lucija, Elisheba Spiller, and Christopher Timmins. &#x201C;Shale Gas Development and the Costs of Groundwater Contamination Risk.&#x201D; SSRN Scholarly Paper.

Two diﬀerent impact assessment methods estimate the HTI of shale gas electricity to be 1−2 orders of magnitude less than the HTI of coal electricity (0.016−0.024 DALY/ GWh versus 0.69−1.7 DALY/GWh). Further, an implausible shale gas scenario where all fracturing ﬂuid and untreated produced water is discharged directly to surface water throughout the lifetime of a well also has a lower HTI than coal electricity. Particulate matter dominates the HTI for both systems, representing a much larger contribution to the overall toxicity burden than VOCs or any aquatic emission. Aquatic emissions can become larger contributors to the HTI when waste products are inadequately disposed or there are signiﬁcant infrastructure or equipment failures. Large uncertainty and lack of exposure data prevent a full risk assessment; however, the results of this analysis provide a comparison of relative toxicity, which can be used to identify target areas for improvement and assess potential trade-oﬀs with other environmental impacts.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"21","pages":"13018-13027","date":"2017-11-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.7b03546","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b03546","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:33:12Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T04:33:12Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T04:33:14Z"}},{"key":"9KDV8THY","version":2066,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9KDV8THY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9KDV8THY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goebel et al.","parsedDate":"2017-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goebel, Thomas H.

Statewide injection rates peaked in early 2015 and steadily decreased thereafter, approximately coinciding with collapsing oil prices and regulatory action. If seismic activity is primarily driven by fluid injection, a noticeable seismogenic response to the decrease in injection rates is expected. Langenbruch and Zoback suggest that “the probability of potentially damaging larger events, should significantly decrease by the end of 2016 and approach historic levels within a few years.” We agree that the rate of small earthquakes has decreased toward the second half of 2016. However, their specific predictions about seismic hazard require reexamination. We test the influence of the model parameters of Langenbruch and Zoback based on fits to observed seismicity distributions. The results suggest that a range of realistic aftershock decay rates and b values can lead to an increase in moderate earthquake probabilities from 37 to 80% in 2017 without any further alteration to the model. In addition, the observation that all four M ≥ 5 earthquakes to date occurred when injection rates were below the triggering threshold of Langenbruch and Zoback challenges the applicability of the model for the most societally significant events.\nEstimates of seismic response to injection rate reduction in Oklahoma are model-dependent and remain uncertain in 2017 and beyond.\nEstimates of seismic response to injection rate reduction in Oklahoma are model-dependent and remain uncertain in 2017 and beyond.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"8","pages":"e1700441","date":"2017/08/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1700441","ISSN":"2375-2548","shortTitle":"Comment on “How will induced seismicity in Oklahoma respond to decreased saltwater injection rates?","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700441","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:32:36Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"advances.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Much of the existing literature relies on decades-old estimates for water intensity, particularly regarding water consumed for fuel extraction. This work uses contemporary data from specific resource basins and power plants in Texas to evaluate water intensity at three major stages of coal and natural gas fuel cycles: fuel extraction, power plant cooling and power plant emissions controls. In particular, the water intensity of fuel extraction is quantified for Texas lignite, conventional natural gas and 11 unconventional natural gas basins in Texas, including major second-order impacts associated with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. Despite the rise of this water-intensive natural gas extraction method, natural gas extraction appears to consume less freshwater than coal per unit of energy extracted in Texas because of the high water intensity of Texas lignite extraction. This work uses new resource basin and power plant level water intensity data to estimate the potential effects of coal to natural gas fuel switching in Texas’ power sector, a shift under consideration due to potential environmental benefits and very low natural gas prices. Replacing Texas’ coal-fired power plants with natural gas combined cycle plants (NGCCs) would reduce annual freshwater consumption in the state by an estimated 53 billion gallons per year, or 60% of Texas coal power’s water footprint, largely due to the higher efficiency of NGCCs.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"045801","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The study objective was to quantify net water use for shale-gas production using data from Texas, which is the dominant producer of shale gas in the U.S. with a focus on three major plays: the Barnett Shale (∼15 000 wells, mid-2011), Texas-Haynesville Shale (390 wells), and Eagle Ford Shale (1040 wells). Past water use was estimated from well-completion data, and future water use was extrapolated from past water use constrained by shale-gas resources. Cumulative water use in the Barnett totaled 145 Mm3 (2000−mid-2011). Annual water use represents ∼9% of water use in Dallas (population 1.3 million). Water use in younger (2008−mid-2011) plays, although less (6.5 Mm3 TexasHaynesville, 18 Mm3 Eagle Ford), is increasing rapidly. Water use for shale gas is <1% of statewide water withdrawals; however, local impacts vary with water availability and competing demands. Projections of cumulative net water use during the next 50 years in all shale plays total ∼4350 Mm3, peaking at 145 Mm3 in the mid-2020s and decreasing to 23 Mm3 in 2060. Current freshwater use may shift to brackish water to reduce competition with other users.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"46","issue":"6","pages":"3580-3586","date":"2012-03-20","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1021/es204602t","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","shortTitle":"","url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es204602t","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:29:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T04:29:46Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T04:29:50Z"}},{"key":"6VCECXST","version":2054,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6VCECXST","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6VCECXST","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Warner et al.","parsedDate":"2012-07-24","numChildren":3},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Warner, Nathaniel R., Robert B.

Concerns include the potential for migration of stray gas, metal-rich formation brines, and hydraulic fracturing and/or flowback fluids to drinking water aquifers. A critical question common to these environmental risks is the hydraulic connectivity between the shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers. We present geochemical evidence from northeastern Pennsylvania showing that pathways, unrelated to recent drilling activities, exist in some locations between deep underlying formations and shallow drinking water aquifers. Integration of chemical data (Br, Cl, Na, Ba, Sr, and Li) and isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 2H/H, 18O/16O, and 228Ra/226Ra) from this and previous studies in 426 shallow groundwater samples and 83 northern Appalachian brine samples suggest that mixing relationships between shallow ground water and a deep formation brine causes groundwater salinization in some locations. The strong geochemical fingerprint in the salinized (Cl > 20 mg/L) groundwater sampled from the Alluvium, Catskill, and Lock Haven aquifers suggests possible migration of Marcellus brine through naturally occurring pathways. The occurrences of saline water do not correlate with the location of shale-gas wells and are consistent with reported data before rapid shale-gas development in the region; however, the presence of these fluids suggests conductive pathways and specific geostructural and/or hydrodynamic regimes in northeastern Pennsylvania that are at increased risk for contamination of shallow drinking water resources, particularly by fugitive gases, because of natural hydraulic connections to deeper formations.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"109","issue":"30","pages":"11961-11966","date":"2012/07/24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1121181109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/11961","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:28:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"©  .

As shale development has expanded — largely as a result of new horizontal drilling and “slickwater” hydraulic fracturing (fracking, fracing, or hydofracking) techniques — questions have arisen regarding the environmental risks of drilling and fracturing in shales and how laws, policies, and regulations address these risks. To understand whether and how regulation addresses risks, one must know both the content of regulations and how they are applied through inspections of well sites, notations of violations, and/or enforcement. An accompanying paper by this author, entitled “Regulation of Shale Gas Development, Including Hydraulic Fracturing” addresses the content of federal, regional, state, and local regulations that apply to shale gas development; this paper explores, in a preliminary fashion, how these regulations are applied. It briefly surveys complaints about shale gas and tight sands development (both of which typically require fracturing) lodged by citizens with state agencies, states’ notation of environmental violations at shale gas and tight sands wells both in response to these complaints and as a result of independently-instigated site visits or self-reported violations, and states’ capacity to inspect sites and enforce violations noted. The objective of this “on-the-ground” review of shale gas development regulatory activities is to offer a preliminary picture of the environmental effects of shale gas development and how states address them through citations of violations and/or initiation of enforcement action. Regulations have little effect if they are rarely applied to regulated actors or only sporadically enforced. Looking to both the content of regulations, violations of the regulations, and enforcement therefore provides a more complete regulatory picture. The Energy Institute at the University of Texas funded the research for this paper.","reportNumber":"ID 1992064","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2011/08/25","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1992064","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:24:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"enforcement","type":1},{"tag":"environment","type":1},{"tag":"environmental","type":1},{"tag":"frac","type":1},{"tag":"fracing","type":1},{"tag":"frack","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"fracture","type":1},{"tag":"fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"hydrofracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydrofracturing","type":1},{"tag":"regulation","type":1},{"tag":"state","type":1},{"tag":"violations","type":1}],"collections":["9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T04:24:20Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T04:24:28Z"}},{"key":"X2PMZ4LT","version":2041,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X2PMZ4LT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X2PMZ4LT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kim","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kim, Won-Young. &#x201C;Induced Seismicity Associated with Fluid Injection into a Deep Well in Youngstown, Ohio.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</i> 118, no. 7: 3506&#x2013;18.

These shocks were close to a deep fluid injection well. The 14 month seismicity included six felt earthquakes and culminated with a Mw 3.9 shock on 31 December 2011. Among the 109 shocks, 12 events greater than Mw 1.8 were detected by regional network and accurately relocated, whereas 97 small earthquakes (0.4 < Mw < 1.8) were detected by the waveform correlation detector. Accurately located earthquakes were along a subsurface fault trending ENE-WSW—consistent with the focal mechanism of the main shock and occurred at depths 3.5–4.0 km in the Precambrian basement. We conclude that the recent earthquakes in Youngstown, Ohio were induced by the fluid injection at a deep injection well due to increased pore pressure along the preexisting subsurface faults located close to the wellbore. We found that the seismicity initiated at the eastern end of the subsurface fault—close to the injection point, and migrated toward the west—away from the wellbore, indicating that the expanding high fluid pressure front increased the pore pressure along its path and progressively triggered the earthquakes. We observe that several periods of quiescence of seismicity follow the minima in injection volumes and pressure, which may indicate that the earthquakes were directly caused by the pressure buildup and stopped when pressure dropped.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","volume":"118","issue":"7","pages":"3506-3518","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/jgrb.50247","ISSN":"2169-9356","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgrb.50247","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:15:37Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2013.

This area includes the Eagle Ford Shale. For decades this geographic region has produced gas and oil from other strata using conventional methods, but recent developments in hydrofracturing technology has allowed extensive development of natural gas resources from within the Eagle Ford. Our study surveys small-magnitude seismic events and evaluates their correlation with fluid extraction and injection in the Eagle Ford, identifying and locating 62 probable earthquakes, including 58 not reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. The 62 probable earthquakes occur singly or in clusters at 14 foci; of these foci, two were situated near wells injecting recently increased volumes of water; eight were situated near wells extracting recently increased volumes of oil and/or water; and four were not situated near wells reporting significant injection/extraction increases. Thus in this region, while the majority of small earthquakes may be triggered/induced by human activity, they are more often associated with fluid extraction than with injection. We also investigated the MW4.8 20 October 2011 Fashing earthquake—the largest historically reported earthquake in south-central Texas—that occurred two weeks after the removal of the temporary USArray stations. A field study indicated that the highest-intensity (MMI VI) region was about 10 km south of 2010–2011 foreshock activity, and that there were no high-volume injection wells within 20 km of the MMI V–VI region or the foreshocks. However, the 20 October 2011 earthquake did coincide with a significant increase in oil/water extraction volumes at wells within the MMI V–VI region, and this was also true for previous earthquakes felt at Fashing in 1973 and 1983. In contrast, our study found significant increases in injection prior to an mbLG3.6 20 July 1991 earthquake near Falls City, Texas. Thus the Eagle Ford geographic region, with seismic activity associated both with extraction and injection, appears to be more complex than the Barnett Shale of northeast Texas, where a similar survey found possible correlations only with fluid injection.","publicationTitle":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","volume":"379","issue":"","pages":"56-63","date":"October 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2013.07.025","ISSN":"0012-821X","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13004007","accessDate":"2018-07-28T04:10:57Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"EarthScope USArray","type":1},{"tag":"energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"induced earthquakes","type":1},{"tag":"injection wells","type":1},{"tag":"seismic hazard","type":1}],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T04:10:57Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T04:11:08Z"}},{"key":"7MDSLBYY","version":2028,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7MDSLBYY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7MDSLBYY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barbot et al.","parsedDate":"2013-03-19","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Barbot, Elise, Natasa S.

Confounding these challenges is a scant availability of critical water quality parameters for this wastewater. Chemical analyses of 160 flowback and produced water samples collected from hydraulically fractured Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania were correlated with spatial and temporal information to reveal underlying trends. Chloride was used as a reference for the comparison as its concentration varies with time of contact with the shale. Most major cations (i.e., Ca, Mg, Sr) were well-correlated with chloride concentration while barium exhibited strong influence of geographic location (i.e., higher levels in the northeast than in southwest). Comparisons against brines from adjacent formations provide insight into the origin of salinity in produced waters from Marcellus Shale. Major cations exhibited variations that cannot be explained by simple dilution of existing formation brine with the fracturing fluid, especially during the early flowback water production when the composition of the fracturing fluid and solid–liquid interactions influence the quality of the produced water. Water quality analysis in this study may help guide water management strategies for development of unconventional gas resources.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"6","pages":"2562-2569","date":"March 19, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

A larger proportion of horizontal wells and an increasing number of hydraulically fractured well bores are being completed in the United States, and consequently increasing water demand by oil and gas operations. Management, planning, and regulatory decisions for water, oil, and gas are largely made at the state-level; therefore, it is necessary to aggregate water use and energy production data at the state-scale. The purpose of this paper is to quantify annual volumes of water used for completion of oil and gas wells, coproduced during oil and gas production, injected via underground injection program wells, and used in water flooding operations. Data from well completion reports, and tax commission records were synthesized to arrive at these estimates for Oklahoma. Hydraulic fracturing required a median fluid volume of 11 350 m3 per horizontal well in Oklahoma. Median fluid volume (∼15 774 m3) and volume per perforated interval (15.73 m3 m–1) were highest for Woodford Shale horizontal wells. State-scale annual water use for oil and gas well completions was estimated to be up to 16.3 Mm3 in 2011 or less than 1% of statewide freshwater use. Statewide annual produced water volumes ranged from 128.5 to 146.6 Mm3, with gas wells yielding an estimated 72.4% of the total coproduced water. Volumes of water injected into underground injection control program wells ranged from 206.8 to 305.4 Mm3, which indicates that water flooding operations may use up to 167.0 Mm3 per year. State-scale water use estimates for Oklahoma could be improved by requiring oil and gas operators to supplement well completion reports with water use and water production data. Reporting of oil and gas production data by well using a unique identifier (i.e., API number) would also allow for refinement of produced water quantity information. Reporting of wastewater disposal and water flooding volumes could be used to further develop state-scale water accounting and best management practices.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"9","pages":"4918-4925","date":"May 7, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

UF modules were further modified by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) brushes to the polydopamine coating. Polydopamine and polydopamine-g-PEG coatings increase hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces and have previously been shown to improve fouling resistance towards model oil/water emulsions in laboratory studies. In a pilot-scale test treating hydraulic fracturing flowback water from the Barnett Shale region of Texas, the fouling performance of modified UF and RO membrane modules was compared to that of unmodified analogs. UF modules were used to remove most of the highly fouling organic matter in the feed before desalination by a train of RO elements. Polydopamine-modified UF modules maintained higher flux, lower transmembrane pressure difference, and improved cleaning efficiency relative to unmodified modules. The polydopamine coating did not appear to improve RO fouling behavior, presumably because most of the organic foulants had been removed by UF pretreatment of the feedwater. However, higher and more stable salt rejection was observed in modified RO modules than in unmodified modules.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Membrane Science","volume":"437","issue":"","pages":"265-275","date":"June 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Membrane Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.019","ISSN":"0376-7388","shortTitle":"Fouling-resistant membranes for the treatment of flowback water from hydraulic shale fracturing","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738813002147","accessDate":"2018-07-28T01:49:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Membrane fouling","type":1},{"tag":"Polydopamine","type":1},{"tag":"Surface modification","type":1},{"tag":"Water purification","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T01:49:58Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T01:50:06Z"}},{"key":"M7ZRQCIF","version":2006,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M7ZRQCIF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M7ZRQCIF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Rahm et al.","parsedDate":"2013-05-15","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Rahm, Brian G., Josephine T.

Global shale gas development is seen as a potential energy and geopolitical “game-changer.” However, widespread concern exists with respect to possible environmental consequences of this development, particularly impacts on water resources. In the United States, where the most shale gas extraction has occurred, the Marcellus Shale is now the largest natural gas producing play. To date, over 6,000,000 m3 of wastewater has been generated in the process of extracting natural gas from this shale in the state of Pennsylvania (PA) alone. Here we examine wastewater management practices and trends for this shale play through analysis of industry-reported, publicly available data collected from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Oil and Gas Reporting Website. We also analyze the tracking and transport of shale gas liquid waste streams originating in PA using a combination of web-based and GIS approaches. From 2008 to 2011 wastewater reuse increased, POTW use decreased, and data tracking became more complete, while the average distance traveled by wastewater decreased by over 30%. Likely factors influencing these trends include state regulations and policies, along with low natural gas prices. Regional differences in wastewater management are influenced by industrial treatment capacity, as well as proximity to injection disposal capacity. Using lessons from the Marcellus Shale, we suggest that nations, states, and regulatory agencies facing new unconventional shale development recognize that pace and scale of well drilling leads to commensurate wastewater management challenges. We also suggest they implement wastewater reporting and tracking systems, articulate a policy for adapting management to evolving data and development patterns, assess local and regional wastewater treatment infrastructure in terms of capacity and capability, promote well-regulated on-site treatment technologies, and review and update wastewater management regulations and policies.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Management","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"105-113","date":"May 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Management","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.029","ISSN":"0301-4797","shortTitle":"Wastewater management and Marcellus Shale gas development","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479713001175","accessDate":"2018-07-28T01:47:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy-water nexus","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Marcellus","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Wastewater","type":1},{"tag":"Wastewater treatment","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-28T01:47:47Z","dateModified":"2018-07-28T01:48:28Z"}},{"key":"R35WCCBR","version":2004,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R35WCCBR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R35WCCBR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"North et al.","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">North, D.

Shale gas development is one such emerging technology. Drawing on previous U.S. National Research Council committee reports that examined risk decision making for complex issues like these, we point to the benefits and challenges of applying the analytic-deliberative process recommened in those reports for stakeholder and public engagement in risk decision making about shale gas development in the United States. We discuss the different phases of such a process and conclude by noting the dangers of allowing controversy to ossify and the benefits of sound dialogue and learning among publics, stakeholders, industry, and regulatory decision makers.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8388-8396","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In this paper the volatility of US natural gas prices is investigated using daily Henry Hub futures data for the period 1996 to 2011. The purpose is to determine the best conditional volatility model for forecasting and modeling, and to investigate the fundamental drivers of volatility. Several models are applied and compared on the basis of explanatory power, post-estimation tests, as well as in- and out-of-sample one-day-ahead forecasting capabilities evaluated using the Dynamic Quantile Test and Kupiec LR test. Based on these evaluation criteria EGARCH is found superior to GARCH, GJR, IGARCH, RiskMetrics and APARCH. Additionally, EGARCH is found satisfactory when evaluating 5, 10 and 20-day-ahead forecasts using the Kupiec LR test on Monte Carlo simulated VaR levels. To investigate the drivers of volatility, proxies for each determinant are included in the conditional volatility models and in an OLS framework. Economic activity, seasonality and daily effects are found to be statistical significant, with the daily effects having the largest influence, while oil volatility, changes in temperature, production and storage levels are insignificant. From the results it can be concluded that if the aim of the conditional volatility modeling is short-term forecasting, the determinants should be excluded as they do not improve forecasting accuracy. Conversely, if the aim is to explain the causes of volatility, the in-sample evaluation indicate that the inclusion of determinants is a reasonable approach, and a good foundation for scenario analyses. Our findings are useful for producers, traders, risk managers and other market participants as they provide an accurate measure of price risk, and can be used to understand the causes of volatility.","publicationTitle":"101","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"eng","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/266275","accessDate":"2018-07-27T21:10:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"brage.bibsys.no","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-27T21:10:09Z","dateModified":"2018-07-27T21:10:09Z"}},{"key":"8SEDDD5N","version":3475,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8SEDDD5N","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8SEDDD5N","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Nijboer","parsedDate":"2010-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

In Pennsylvania's Marcellus gas fields, the recent development of unconventional shale gas resources has not been without controversy. It has been variously framed as a major opportunity for economic revitalization at the local and regional levels and energy independence at the national level, but also as a significant environmental risk, with uncertain and uneven economic benefits. We use data from a survey conducted in 309 school districts located within Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region to study the ways local stakeholders perceive both risk and opportunity associated with gas extraction from Marcellus Shale. Our analyses indicate that there is a strong positive association between perceptions of risk and opportunity associated with gas extraction. Further, the intensity of perception of both risk and opportunity is directly associated with the amount of local drilling, suggesting the complexity of local contexts within which local stakeholders evaluate rapid boomtown-associated community change. In total, these findings complicate the framing of unconventional gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale region, and indeed boomtown growth overall, as fundamentally polarizing issues.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"78","issue":"2","pages":"143-166","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12004","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ruso.12004","accessDate":"2018-07-27T20:54:12Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, by the Rural Sociological Society","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-27T20:54:12Z","dateModified":"2018-07-27T20:54:48Z"}},{"key":"9NAL372A","version":1966,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9NAL372A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9NAL372A","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hesterberg et al.","parsedDate":"2009-04-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hesterberg, Thomas, William Bunn, and Charles Lapin. &#x201C;An Evaluation of Criteria for Selecting Vehicles Fueled with Diesel or Compressed Natural Gas.&#x201D; <i>Sustainability: Science, Practice and Policy</i> 5, no. 1 (April 1, 2009): 20&#x2013;30. https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2009.11908025.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9NAL372A","version":1966,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An evaluation of criteria for selecting vehicles fueled with diesel or compressed natural gas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Hesterberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"William","lastName":"Bunn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Lapin"}],"abstractNote":"We reviewed selection criteria for diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled vehicles, comparing engine emissions, fire and safety, toxicity, economics, and operations. Diesel- and CNG-fueled vehicles with the latest emissioncontrol technology, including engine-exhaust aftertreatment, have very similar emissions of regulated and unregulated compounds, particles through all size ranges, and greenhouse gases. Although toxicity data are limited, no significant toxicity differences of engine emissions were reported. Operating and maintenance costs are variable, with no consistent difference between diesel- and CNG-fueled vehicles. The main operating concern with CNG vehicles is that they are less fuel efficient. Higher infrastructure costs are involved with implementing a CNG-fueled vehicle fleet, giving diesel vehicles a distinct cost advantage over CNG vehicles. For a given budget, greater emissions reductions can thus be achieved with diesel+filter vehicles. Finally, diesel vehicles have a significant fire-and-safety advantage over CNG vehicles. In summary, infrastructure costs and fire-and-safety concerns are much greater for CNG-fueled vehicles. These considerations should be part of the decision-making process when selecting a fuel for a transportation system.","publicationTitle":"Sustainability: Science, Practice and Policy","volume":"5","issue":"1","pages":"20-30","date":"April 1, 2009","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/15487733.2009.11908025","ISSN":"null","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2009.11908025","accessDate":"2018-07-27T20:43:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"automotive exhaust emissions","type":1},{"tag":"cost-benefit analysis","type":1},{"tag":"engines","type":1},{"tag":"fuels","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gases","type":1},{"tag":"safety","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-27T20:43:03Z","dateModified":"2018-07-27T20:43:03Z"}},{"key":"3UFK2BIN","version":3471,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3UFK2BIN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3UFK2BIN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Burtraw et al.","parsedDate":"2012-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Burtraw, Dallas, Karen Palmer, Anthony Paul, and Matt Woerman. &#x201C;Secular Trends, Environmental Regulations, and Electricity Markets.&#x201D; <i>The Electricity Journal</i> 25, no. 6 (July 1, 2012): 35&#x2013;47. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2012.06.010.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3UFK2BIN","version":3471,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Secular Trends, Environmental Regulations, and Electricity Markets","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dallas","lastName":"Burtraw"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Palmer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Paul"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Woerman"}],"abstractNote":"A simulation model of the U.S. electricity market to examine the impact of natural gas prices and future electricity demand growth on the electricity industry suggests that recent downward adjustments in natural gas prices and electricity demand projections have a substantially larger impact on electricity prices and generation mix than do the new EPA regulations.","publicationTitle":"The Electricity Journal","volume":"25","issue":"6","pages":"35-47","date":"July 1, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Electricity Journal","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.tej.2012.06.010","ISSN":"1040-6190","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619012001546","accessDate":"2018-07-27T20:20:52Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-27T20:20:52Z","dateModified":"2018-07-27T20:20:52Z"}},{"key":"4R9HLN82","version":3467,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4R9HLN82","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4R9HLN82","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Krupnick, Alan, Zhongmin Wang, and Yushuang Wang. &#x201C;Sector Effects of the Shale Gas Revolution in the United States.&#x201D; <i>SSRN Electronic Journal</i>, 2013. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2296080.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4R9HLN82","version":3467,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sector Effects of the Shale Gas Revolution in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Krupnick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhongmin","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yushuang","lastName":"Wang"}],"abstractNote":"This paper reviews the impact of the shale gas revolution on the sectors of electricity generation, transportation, and manufacturing in the United States.

In addition, our assessment of isotopic and molecular analyses of hydrocarbon gases in the Dimock Township suggest that gases present in local water wells are most consistent with Middle and Upper Devonian gases sampled in the annular spaces of local gas wells, as opposed to Marcellus Production gas. Combined, these findings suggest that the methane concentrations in Susquehanna County water wells can be explained without the migration of Marcellus shale gas through fractures, an observation that has important implications for understanding the nature of risks associated with shale-gas extraction.","publicationTitle":"Groundwater","volume":"51","issue":"3","pages":"333-349","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/gwat.12056","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gwat.12056","accessDate":"2018-07-27T17:17:51Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2013, Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation.

These techniques carry potential environmental risk due to their high water use and substantial risk for water pollution. Using probability bounds analysis, we assessed the likelihood of water contamination from natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale. Probability bounds analysis is well suited when data are sparse and parameters highly uncertain. The study model identified five pathways of water contamination: transportation spills, well casing leaks, leaks through fractured rock, drilling site discharge, and wastewater disposal. Probability boxes were generated for each pathway. The potential contamination risk and epistemic uncertainty associated with hydraulic fracturing wastewater disposal was several orders of magnitude larger than the other pathways. Even in a best-case scenario, it was very likely that an individual well would release at least 200 m3 of contaminated fluids. Because the total number of wells in the Marcellus Shale region could range into the tens of thousands, this substantial potential risk suggested that additional steps be taken to reduce the potential for contaminated fluid leaks. To reduce the considerable epistemic uncertainty, more data should be collected on the ability of industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities to remove contaminants from used hydraulic fracturing fluid.","publicationTitle":"Risk Analysis","volume":"32","issue":"8","pages":"1382-1393","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01757.x","ISSN":"1539-6924","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01757.x","accessDate":"2018-07-26T21:44:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2012 Society for Risk Analysis","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Marcellus","type":1},{"tag":"probability bounds analysis","type":1},{"tag":"water","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T21:44:18Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T21:44:26Z"}},{"key":"6AZNNLUP","version":1905,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6AZNNLUP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6AZNNLUP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kriesky et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kriesky, J., B.

Through analysis of telephone survey responses, we explore support for natural gas drilling in residents of Washington County (WC), PA (n=502) vs. residents of Allegheny County (AC), PA (n=799). WC has had intense Marcellus Shale (MS) drilling activity, in comparison to adjacent AC, which has had little drilling activity. WC residents are marginally more supportive of MS drilling than are AC residents (p=0.0768). Residents of WC are more likely to perceive MS as an economic opportunity than are AC residents (p=0.0015); to be in a family that has signed a MS lease (p<0.0001); to follow the MS issue closely (p=0.0003); to get MS information from neighbors, friends, and relatives (p<0.0001); and are marginally less likely to perceive MS as an environmental threat (p=0.1090). WC leaseholders are significantly more supportive of MS drilling than WC non-leaseholders and AC non-leaseholders (p=0.0024). Mediation analyses show that county-based differences in support of MS drilling are due to WC residents seeing more of an economic opportunity in the MS and their greater likelihood of having a family-held lease.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"58","issue":"","pages":"228-236","date":"July 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2013.03.005","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513001596","accessDate":"2018-07-26T21:22:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydrofracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas drilling","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T21:22:34Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T21:22:39Z"}},{"key":"IB4BYVLR","version":1900,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IB4BYVLR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IB4BYVLR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Esswein et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Esswein, Eric J., Michael Breitenstein, John Snawder, Max Kiefer, and W.

Hydraulic fracturing involves high pressure injection of large volumes of water and sand, and smaller quantities of well treatment chemicals, into a gas or oil well to fracture shale or other rock formations, allowing more efficient recovery of hydrocarbons from a petroleum-bearing reservoir. Crystalline silica (\"frac sand\") is commonly used as a proppant to hold open cracks and fissures created by hydraulic pressure. Each stage of the process requires hundreds of thousands of pounds of quartz-containing sand; millions of pounds may be needed for all zones of a well. Mechanical handling of frac sand creates respirable crystalline silica dust, a potential exposure hazard for workers. Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health collected 111 personal breathing zone samples at 11 sites in five states to evaluate worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing. At each of the 11 sites, full-shift samples exceeded occupational health criteria (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration calculated permissible exposure limit, the NIOSH recommended exposure limit, or the ACGIH threshold limit value), in some cases, by 10 or more times the occupational health criteria. Based on these evaluations, an occupational health hazard was determined to exist for workplace exposures to crystalline silica. Seven points of dust generation were identified, including sand handling machinery and dust generated from the work site itself. Recommendations to control exposures include product substitution (when feasible), engineering controls or modifications to sand handling machinery, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment. To our knowledge, this represents the first systematic study of work crew exposures to crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing. Companies that conduct hydraulic fracturing using silica sand should evaluate their operations to determine the potential for worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica and implement controls as necessary to protect workers.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","volume":"10","issue":"7","pages":"347-356","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J Occup Environ Hyg","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1080/15459624.2013.788352","ISSN":"1545-9632","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23679563","tags":[{"tag":"Analysis of Variance","type":1},{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Inhalation Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Occupational Exposure","type":1},{"tag":"Risk Assessment","type":1},{"tag":"Silicon Dioxide","type":1},{"tag":"Weather","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T21:19:08Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T21:19:12Z"}},{"key":"CVSMMHH3","version":1899,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/CVSMMHH3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/CVSMMHH3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"R.

In Pennsylvania's Marcellus gas fields, the recent development of unconventional shale gas resources has not been without controversy. It has been variously framed as a major opportunity for economic revitalization at the local and regional levels and energy independence at the national level, but also as a significant environmental risk, with uncertain and uneven economic benefits. We use data from a survey conducted in 309 school districts located within Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region to study the ways local stakeholders perceive both risk and opportunity associated with gas extraction from Marcellus Shale. Our analyses indicate that there is a strong positive association between perceptions of risk and opportunity associated with gas extraction. Further, the intensity of perception of both risk and opportunity is directly associated with the amount of local drilling, suggesting the complexity of local contexts within which local stakeholders evaluate rapid boomtown-associated community change. In total, these findings complicate the framing of unconventional gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale region, and indeed boomtown growth overall, as fundamentally polarizing issues.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"78","issue":"2","pages":"143-166","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12004","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ruso.12004","accessDate":"2018-07-26T19:59:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, by the Rural Sociological Society","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T19:59:21Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T19:59:21Z"}},{"key":"SDI3HU3W","version":3427,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SDI3HU3W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SDI3HU3W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brasier et al.","parsedDate":"2011-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Brasier, Kathryn, Matthew R Filteau, Diane McLaughlin, Jeffrey Jacquet, Richard Stedman, Tim Kelsey, and Stephan J Goetz. &#x201C;Residents&#x2019; Perceptions of Community and Environmental Impacts From Development of Natural Gas in the Marcellus Shale: A Comparison of Pennsylvania and New York Cases.&#x201D; <i>Journal of Rural Social Sciences</i> 26 (January 1, 2011): 32&#x2013;61.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"SDI3HU3W","version":3427,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Residents' Perceptions of Community and Environmental Impacts From Development of Natural Gas in the Marcellus Shale: A Comparison of Pennsylvania and New York Cases","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kathryn","lastName":"Brasier"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"R Filteau"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Diane","lastName":"McLaughlin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Jacquet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Stedman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Kelsey"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"J Goetz"}],"abstractNote":"Communities experiencing rapid growth due to energy development ('boomtowns') have reported positive and negative impacts on community and individual well-being.

We exploit variation in distance to nearby gas wells in home sale prices to estimate this effect. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on a relatively densely populated area, a section of the Dallas–Ft. Worth–Arlington urban area. Using a dataset of 127,556 observations from Tarrant County, Texas over the period 2005–2011, we find robust evidence that increased proximity to a well leads to reduced home sale prices.

In some circumstances, public policy intervention to overcome obstacles to innovation may be justified to secure public benefits. One obstacle is that innovators may be unable to capture all of the available economic benefits of innovation. Another is that economic benefits may not be available and the value of the public good has not been internalized in the market.

It can also serve as a transition fuel that will allow for the shift from coal to renewable energy resources while helping to reduce the emissions of CO2, criteria pollutants, and mercury by the power sector. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. The focus of this Review is on the current understanding of these environmental issues.\n<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/340/6134/1235009/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> Drilling multiple horizontal wells from a single well pad allows access to as much as 1 square mile of shale that is located more than a mile below. [Image courtesy of Range Resources Appalachia]\nAdvances The most common problem with well construction is a faulty seal that is emplaced to prevent gas migration into shallow groundwater. The incidence rate of seal problems in unconventional gas wells is relatively low (1 to 3%), but there is a substantial controversy whether the methane detected in private groundwater wells in the area where drilling for unconventional gas is ongoing was caused by well drilling or natural processes. It is difficult to resolve this issue because many areas have long had sources of methane unrelated to hydraulic fracturing, and pre-drilling baseline data are often unavailable. Water management for unconventional shale gas extraction is one of the key issues that will dominate environmental debate surrounding the gas industry. Reuse of produced water for hydraulic fracturing is currently addressing the concerns regarding the vast quantities of contaminants that are brought to the surface. As these well fields mature and the opportunities for wastewater reuse diminish, the need to find alternative management strategies for this wastewater will likely intensify.\nOutlook Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help effectively manage water-quality risks associated with unconventional gas industry today and in the future. Confidentiality requirements dictated by legal investigations combined with the expedited rate of development and the limited funding for research are major impediments to peer-reviewed research into environmental impacts. Now is the time to work on these environmental issues to avoid an adverse environmental legacy similar to that from abandoned coal mine discharges in Pennsylvania.\nFracturing Hydrology?\nHydraulic fracturing, widely known as \"fracking,\" is a relatively inexpensive way to tap into what were previously inaccessible natural gas resources. Vidic et al. (p. 826) review the current status of shale gas development and discuss the possible threats to water resources. In one of the hotbeds of fracking activity, the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States, there is little evidence that additives have directly entered groundwater supplies, but the risk remains. Ensuring access to monitoring data is an important first step toward addressing any public and environmental health concerns.\nUnconventional natural gas resources offer an opportunity to access a relatively clean fossil fuel that could potentially lead to energy independence for some countries. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing make the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible. These technologies are not free from environmental risks, however, especially those related to regional water quality, such as gas migration, contaminant transport through induced and natural fractures, wastewater discharge, and accidental spills. We review the current understanding of environmental issues associated with unconventional gas extraction. Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants of concern and increased long-term monitoring and data dissemination will help manage these water-quality risks today and in the future.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"340","issue":"6134","pages":"1235009","date":"2013/05/17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.1235009","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/1235009","accessDate":"2018-07-26T16:29:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2013, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 23687049","tags":[],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T16:29:47Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T16:30:14Z"}},{"key":"2WQH7CD7","version":1859,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2WQH7CD7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2WQH7CD7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Davis and Kilian","parsedDate":"2008-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Davis, Lucas W, and Lutz Kilian. &#x201C;The Allocative Cost of Price Ceilings in the U.S. Residential Market for Natural Gas.&#x201D; Working Paper.

The resulting allocative cost has been discussed in the literature as a potentially important component of the total welfare loss from price ceilings, but its practical importance has yet to be established empirically. In this paper, we address this question using data for the U.S. residential market for natural gas which was subject to price ceilings during 1954-1989. This market is well suited for such an empirical analysis and natural gas price ceilings affected millions of households. Using a household-level, discrete-continuous model of natural gas demand, we estimate that the allocative cost in the U.S. residential market for natural gas averaged $4.6 billion annually since the 1950s, effectively tripling previous estimates of the net welfare loss to U.S. consumers. We quantify the evolution of this allocative cost and its geographical distribution during the post-war period, and we highlight implications of our analysis for the regulation of other markets.","reportNumber":"14030","reportType":"Working Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"National Bureau of Economic Research","date":"May 2008","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w14030","accessDate":"2018-07-26T16:25:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"National Bureau of Economic Research","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.3386/w14030","tags":[],"collections":["4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T16:25:35Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T16:25:50Z"}},{"key":"H98PV2QC","version":1858,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H98PV2QC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H98PV2QC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Breyer and MacAvoy","parsedDate":"1973","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Breyer, Stephen, and Paul W.

From the perspectives of both the lawyer and the economist, Professors Breyer and MacAvoy lend support to a policy change in this direction. They show that regulation of gas wellhead prices raises problems substantially different from the regulation of traditional public utilities. They argue that the policies the Commission has pursued were almost inevitably bound to result in wellhead prices below the market level that would call forth supplies sufficient to meet demand, and, through econometric analysis, they demonstrate the extent to which the Commission's pricing practices produced the shortage.

There have been several major developments in the industry over the last decade that have led to dramatic reductions in the cost of finding and developing oil and natural gas resources. While some of the cost savings are organizational and institutional in nature, the most important changes are in the application of new technologies used to find and produce oil and gas: 3D seismology, horizontal drilling, and deepwater drilling. Not all the innovation is endogenous to the industry; some rests on outside advances (such as advances in high-speed computing that enabled 3D seismology), as well as learning-by-doing. The increased productivity of mature petroleum provinces like the U.S. helps to maintain competition in the world oil market as well as enhance domestic industry returns.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"97","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T16:11:07Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T16:11:22Z"}},{"key":"YCYQV8BZ","version":1850,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YCYQV8BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YCYQV8BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Munasib and Rickman","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Munasib, Abdul, and Dan S.

Exploration, drilling and extraction are associated with direct increases in employment and income in the energy industry, but little is known about the impacts on other parts of local economies. Increased energy sector employment and income can have positive spillover effects through increased purchases of intermediate goods and induced local spending. Negative spillover effects can occur through rising local factor and goods prices and adverse effects on the local area quality of life. Therefore, this paper examines the net economic impacts of oil and gas production from shale formations for key shale oil and gas producing areas in Arkansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is used to establish a baseline projection for the local economies in the absence of increased energy development, allowing for estimation of the net regional economic effects of increased shale oil and gas production.","publicationTitle":"Regional Science and Urban Economics","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"1-17","date":"01/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2014.10.006","ISSN":"0166-0462","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046214001094","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts"},{"tag":"Shale oil and gas"},{"tag":"Synthetic control method"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:12Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T15:20:04Z"}},{"key":"QMRC2BE9","version":1848,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QMRC2BE9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QMRC2BE9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bolden et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bolden, Ashley L., Kim Schultz, Katherine E.

This occurred largely because of the development of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing which allows access to fossil fuels from geologic formations that were previously not cost effective to pursue. This process is known to use greater than 1,000 chemicals such as solvents, surfactants, detergents, and biocides. In addition, a complex mixture of chemicals, including heavy metals, naturally-occurring radioactive chemicals, and organic compounds are released from the formations and can enter air and water. Compounds associated with UOG activity have been linked to adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes in humans and laboratory animal models, which is possibly due to the presence of endocrine active chemicals. Using systematic methods, electronic searches of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify studies that measured chemicals in air near sites of UOG activity. Records were screened by title and abstract, relevant articles then underwent full text review, and data were extracted from the studies. A list of chemicals detected near UOG sites was generated. Then, the potential endocrine activity of the most frequently detected chemicals was explored via searches of literature from PubMed. Evaluation of 48 studies that sampled air near sites of UOG activity identified 106 chemicals detected in two or more studies. Ethane, benzene and n-pentane were the top three most frequently detected. Twenty-one chemicals have been shown to have endocrine activity including estrogenic and androgenic activity and the ability to alter steroidogenesis. Literature also suggested that some of the air pollutants may affect reproduction, development, and neurophysiological function, all endpoints which can be modulated by hormones. These chemicals included aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mercury. These results provide a basis for prioritizing future primary studies regarding the endocrine disrupting properties of UOG air pollutants, including exposure research in wildlife and humans. Further, we recommend systematic reviews of the health impacts of exposure to specific chemicals, and comprehensive environmental sampling of a broader array of chemicals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Health","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"26","date":"03/21/2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","ISSN":"1476-069X","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0368-z","accessDate":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ehjournal.biomedcentral.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s).","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-26T12:44:40Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T15:15:47Z"}},{"key":"XPYU4ZPE","version":1839,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XPYU4ZPE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XPYU4ZPE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Vengosh et al.","parsedDate":"2013-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Vengosh, Avner, Nathaniel Warner, Rob Jackson, and Tom Darrah. &#x201C;The Effects of Shale Gas Exploration and Hydraulic Fracturing on the Quality of Water Resources in the United States.&#x201D; <i>Procedia Earth and Planetary Science</i>, Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction, WRI 14, 7 (January 1, 2013): 863&#x2013;66. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeps.2013.03.213.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"XPYU4ZPE","version":1839,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Effects of Shale Gas Exploration and Hydraulic Fracturing on the Quality of Water Resources in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Avner","lastName":"Vengosh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nathaniel","lastName":"Warner"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Jackson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Darrah"}],"abstractNote":"Advances in drilling technologies and production strategies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have significantly improved the production of natural gas by stimulating fluid flow from wells. Since 2008, these technological developments have spurred exponential growth of gas well drilling across the U.S. While the new drilling for shale gas and hydraulic fracturing technologies have dramatically changed the energy landscape in the U.S., recent scientific findings show evidence for contamination of water resources. This paper provides key observations for the potential risks of shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing on the quality of water resources and include: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow groundwater overlying shale gas basins; (2) pathways and hydraulic connectivity between the deep shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers; and (3) inadequate disposal of produced and flowback waters associated with shale gas exploration that causes contamination of surface waters and long-term ecological effects. By using geochemical (e.g., Br/Cl) integrated with oxygen, hydrogen, strontium, radium, and boron isotopic tracers, we have characterized the geochemical fingerprints of brines from several shale gas basins in the USA, including the Utica and Marcellus brines in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville brines in Arkansas. We use these geochemical fingerprints to delineate the impact of shale gas associated fluids on the environment.","publicationTitle":"Procedia Earth and Planetary Science","volume":"7","issue":"","pages":"863-866","date":"January 1, 2013","series":"Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction, WRI 14","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Earth and Planetary Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.proeps.2013.03.213","ISSN":"1878-5220","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878522013002944","accessDate":"2018-07-25T22:37:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Produced water","type":1},{"tag":"Salinity","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Stray gas","type":1},{"tag":"Water contamination","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-25T22:37:21Z","dateModified":"2018-07-25T22:38:14Z"}},{"key":"EU7E9DKA","version":1829,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EU7E9DKA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EU7E9DKA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Fraas et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Fraas, Arthur G., Winston Harrington, and Richard D.

Combined with new fuel and vehicle technologies, an opportunity exists to expand the use of NG throughout the economy, including in the light-duty fleet of cars and trucks. This expansion could involve the direct combustion of the gas in the form of compressed natural gas or liquid petroleum gas or, alternatively, the use of natural-gas-based liquid fuels such as ethanol or methanol. This paper examines the potential economic, environmental, and national security gains from replacing a portion of the domestic gasoline use in the light-duty fleet with these various NG-based fuels. Also examined are the regulatory barriers to the expanded use of the fuels. We find that these NG-based fuels could yield significant fuel cost savings relative to conventional gasoline in the light-duty fleet, along with gains to national security and, possibly, some environmental benefits.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2328301","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Cheaper Fuels for the Light-Duty Fleet","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2328301","accessDate":"2018-07-25T22:11:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-25T22:11:40Z","dateModified":"2018-07-25T22:11:40Z"}},{"key":"EEXQLHMA","version":2786,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/EEXQLHMA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/EEXQLHMA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Dusseault et al.","parsedDate":"2000-01-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Dusseault, Maurice B., Malcolm N.

(2012), presents a different interpretation of the atmospheric data and inventory estimates we used to derive our conclusions about methane emissions from oil and natural gas development in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) in Weld County, Colorado. Levi's (2012) Comment brings up new issues that point to the need for additional information. We maintain the value of the results derived in Pétron et al. (2012), particularly that vented and fugitive methane emissions from Weld County's fossil fuel exploration and production in 2008 were likely larger and more uncertain than values reported by emission inventories. Our findings rely on the interpretation of high-quality atmospheric observations using existing inventory data provided by the industry and regulatory agencies and on reasonable assumptions about the average vented raw gas composition. However, Levi (2012) has caused us to extend our analysis and to better characterize the uncertainties associated with his and with our approaches. In this Reply, we examine some critical limitations of the Pétron et al. (2012) and Levi (2012) interpretations of the atmospheric data using simple, two-source emission models that incorporate inventory data sets of unknown reliability. We present new evidence that the regulatory estimates of flashing emission and regulatory modeled composition profiles for a limited number of condensate tanks, the starting point for the calculations of Pétron et al. (2012) and Levi (2012), probably do not represent the true range of these parameters for the thousands of such sources across the DJB in 2008. The results of Levi (2012) suggest that leakage in Weld County in 2008 was biased toward dry gas wells, which disagrees with current inventories of venting and fugitive emissions in U.S. oil and gas fields, including the DJB. Most importantly, the indirect flux derivations undertaken by Levi (2012) and Pétron et al. (2012) highlight two inherent shortcomings common to most emissions inventories: their reliance on the extrapolation of very limited information and the difficulty in carrying out a full uncertainty analysis of such datasets. We agree with Levi (2012) that there is an urgent need to statistically document the composition profiles and magnitudes of significant sources in oil- and gas-producing fields. Observations-based methods with established uncertainties and that are completely independent of inventory information could directly quantify emission strengths and compositions of both point and aggregated area sources, providing an objective assessment of inventory methodology and estimates.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"118","issue":"1","pages":"236-242","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1029/2012JD018487","ISSN":"2169-8996","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2012JD018487","accessDate":"2018-07-25T21:56:37Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2012.

It encourages companies to focus on investments that can secure strong returns, including new plant and equipment, research and development (R&D), and employment and training of highly-qualified personnel.  It also generates capital that companies need to increase their efficiency and innovative capacities.  It also can promote social progress by enabling large numbers of investors to benefit from the returns generated by more efficient, productive and innovative enterprises.  This study examines the distribution of ownership of U.S. publicly-traded oil and natural gas companies.   We found that in 2014, individual investors who were not company executives or directors – “insiders” – owned 65.5 percent of the shares of U.S.-based, publicly traded oil and natural gas companies, measured by the value of all shares.  Most of those shares are held in pension plans and retirement accounts: Public and private pension plans (28.9%), 401(k)s and IRAs (17.9%) held 46.8 percent of the value of all oil and natural gas company shares; individual investors who are not industry executives or directors owned and managed an additional 18.7 percent of the shares outside pension plans and retirement accounts.  In addition, asset management companies held and managed 24.7 percent of the shares on behalf of institutional and individual investors; institutional investors – banks, insurance companies, foundations, endowments – directly owned and managed another 6.9 percent of those shares; and oil and natural gas industry executives held the remaining 2.9 percent of those shares.  We also performed this analysis on each industry segment – integrated oil and natural gas companies, non-integrated operations companies, and service companies.   We found that the integrated segment had the largest holdings by individual investors and the smallest holdings by company insiders.","reportNumber":"ID 2540597","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2014/10/10","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Who Owns America's Oil and Natural Gas Companies","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2540597","accessDate":"2018-07-25T17:40:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"insiders","type":1},{"tag":"institutional investors","type":1},{"tag":"oil and natural gas industry","type":1},{"tag":"ownership","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE","4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-25T17:40:32Z","dateModified":"2018-07-25T17:43:22Z"}},{"key":"ACLIZSH8","version":1785,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ACLIZSH8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ACLIZSH8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sawyer et al.","parsedDate":"2010-12-13","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Sawyer, Hall, Ryan M.

Aggregate revenues from production taxes nearly doubled in real terms over the period, reaching $10.3 billion and accounting for 20% of tax receipts in the top ten revenue states. The average state had a tax rate of 3.6%; nationally, the average dollar of production was taxed at 4.2%. The oil-specific rate estimated for the study period is $2.4 per barrel or $5.5 per ton of carbon. Lastly, state-level tax rates are two-thirds higher in states excluding oil and gas wells from local property taxes, suggesting that the policies are substitutes for one another.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"96","issue":"","pages":"289-301","date":"9","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2016.06.008","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"A quantitative description of state-level taxation of oil and gas production in the continental U.S","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302920","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Effective rates"},{"tag":"Oil and gas taxation"},{"tag":"State policy"}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/43UVYQIR"},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-07-18T17:07:37Z"}},{"key":"VF7WPB8L","version":1738,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VF7WPB8L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VF7WPB8L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Thomas et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

But large vehicles pose an increased danger to occupants of smaller vehicles and to pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists. This paper measures both the internal effect of large vehicles on their own occupants’ safety and their external effect on others. The results show that light trucks are extremely deadly. For each 1 million light trucks that replace cars, between 34 and 93 additional car occupants, pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists are killed per year, and the value of the lives lost is between $242 and $652 million per year. The safety gain that families obtain for themselves from driving large vehicles comes at a very high cost: for each fatal crash that occupants of large vehicles avoid, at least 4.3 additional fatal crashes involving others occur.","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Law and Economics","volume":"47","issue":"2","pages":"333-355","date":"October 1, 2004","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"The Journal of Law and Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1086/422979","ISSN":"0022-2186","shortTitle":"The “Arms Race” on American Roads","url":"https://www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.duke.edu/doi/10.1086/422979","accessDate":"2018-07-18T15:57:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.duke.edu (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-18T15:57:54Z","dateModified":"2018-07-18T15:57:54Z"}},{"key":"Z9MNBJH5","version":1692,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z9MNBJH5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z9MNBJH5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

Through interviews with roughly 250 local officials, we evaluate the fiscal effects of this development in 21 regions across every major US oil and gas producing state during “boom” and “bust” periods. Growing oil and gas production has increased local government revenues through a variety of mechanisms, including property taxes, sales taxes, severance taxes, and more. Industry activity has also increased costs and demand for local services led by road damage, water and wastewater infrastructure, and a range of staff costs including emergency services and law enforcement. Despite volatility in revenues and service demands, our interview results show that 74% of local governments have experienced net fiscal benefits, 14% reported roughly neutral effects, and 12% reported net fiscal costs. Local governments in highly rural regions experiencing large-scale growth have faced the greatest challenges. To further improve future outcomes, local officials can plan for impacts, state policymakers can re-examine revenue policies, and operators can pursue collaboration with local governments.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"117","issue":"","pages":"14-24","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.042","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518301198","accessDate":"2018-07-09T13:03:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:03:26Z","dateModified":"2018-07-18T15:54:27Z"}},{"key":"Q49YC7WI","version":1692,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q49YC7WI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q49YC7WI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2018-01-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

In this paper, we quantify four leading sources: (1) state taxes levied on the value or volume of oil and gas produced; (2) local property taxes levied on the value of oil and gas property; (3) oil and gas lease revenues from state lands; and (4) oil and gas lease revenues from federal lands. We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas-producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10% of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1% to a high of nearly 40% (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments’ current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"112","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"12-18","date":"January 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.002","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517306250","accessDate":"2017-10-26T13:32:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Local public finance","type":1},{"tag":"Property tax","type":1},{"tag":"Resource taxation","type":1},{"tag":"Severance tax","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-07-18T15:54:24Z"}},{"key":"6BGXAG68","version":1691,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6BGXAG68","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6BGXAG68","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2016","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

It begins with a general explanation of fracking and its general impacts along with specifics of the Eagle Ford Shale region. Drawing on data gathered both from crash trends and two surveys administered to public officials in the Eagle Ford Shale region, we present a description of the impacts of fracking on cities and counties. Crash trends between 2009-2013 overall show a 26 percent increase. Fatalities and severe injuries also increased by 49 percent. The survey results show that counties and cities are experiencing significant challenges in meeting increased demands placed on their transportation system by fracking including increased traffic and congestion, deteriorating roads, and increased cost of maintenance.\n\nKeywords: fracking, transportation policy, energy resources, rural traffic, oil","publicationTitle":"Journal of Rural and Community Development","volume":"10","issue":"2","pages":"","date":"2015/07/14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"1712-8277","shortTitle":"Transportation Impacts of Fracking in the Eagle Ford Shale Development in Rural South Texas","url":"http://journals.brandonu.ca/jrcd/article/view/1181","accessDate":"2018-07-18T15:27:16Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"journals.brandonu.ca","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright (c)","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-18T15:27:16Z","dateModified":"2018-07-18T15:27:45Z"}},{"key":"4G4B7XAJ","version":1656,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4G4B7XAJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4G4B7XAJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Muehlenbachs et al.","parsedDate":"2017","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Muehlenbachs, Lucija, Stefan Staubli, and Ziyan Chu. &#x201C;The Accident Externality from Trucking.&#x201D; Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 13-39-REV, 2017. https://doi.org/10.3386/w23791.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"4G4B7XAJ","version":1656,"itemType":"report","title":"The Accident Externality from Trucking","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lucija","lastName":"Muehlenbachs"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Staubli"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ziyan","lastName":"Chu"}],"abstractNote":"The presence of a heavy truck on the road can impose an externality if accidents occur that would not have otherwise.

Our estimates imply two percent of all car-on-car collisions can be attributed to trucks on the road.

Additional low-permeability reservoirs may be considered by project sponsors for development by HVHF. The Department has received applications for permits to drill horizontal wells to evaluate and develop the Marcellus Shale for natural gas production by HVHF.\n\nThe Department has prepared this preliminary Draft Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (“draft SGEIS” or “dSGEIS” or “draft Supplement”) to satisfy the requirements of SEQRA by studying the new technique and identifying potential new significant adverse impacts for these anticipated operations.

The geogenic fraction may contain large amounts of total dissolved solids as well as various hydrocarbons, organic acids, alcohols, radionuclides, and metals. The additives may include surfactants, gels, scale inhibitors, biocides, and friction reducers. Recently, it has been suggested that these produced waters could potentially represent a new water source in areas of water scarcity. Before the use of these waters can be considered for applications outside the oil field, the chemical composition must be better characterized. However, due to the complex nature of these matrices, many methods originally designed for surface and groundwater matrices may not be suitable. In addition, many organic chemicals remain yet unidentified: targeted approaches for organic chemical analysis alone will be insufficient for complete organic chemical characterization. We assessed current trends and emerging technologies in analytical chemistry and reviewed and their applicability to flowback and produced waters. In addition, we propose under-utilized approaches that may serve as potential solutions to address the issues created by the complex matrices inherent to flowback and produced waters.","publicationTitle":"Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry","volume":"15","issue":"","pages":"12-23","date":"July 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.teac.2017.07.002","ISSN":"2214-1588","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214158817300314","accessDate":"2018-07-17T18:28:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Flowback waters","type":1},{"tag":"Gas chromatography","type":1},{"tag":"High-Resolution mass spectrometry","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Liquid chromatography","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas wastewaters","type":1},{"tag":"Produced waters","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-17T18:28:13Z","dateModified":"2018-07-17T18:28:13Z"}},{"key":"8K88TMZG","version":1595,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8K88TMZG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8K88TMZG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hull et al.","parsedDate":"2018-12-10","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hull, Natalie M., James S.

Cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity of FPW were measured via the BioLuminescence Inhibition Assay (BLIA), Ames II mutagenicity assay (AMES), and Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES). Raw FPW stimulated bacteria in BLIA, but were cytotoxic to yeast in YES. Filtered FPW stimulated cell growth in both BLIA and YES. Concentrating 25× by solid phase extraction (SPE) revealed significant toxicity throughout well production by BLIA, toxicity during the first 55 days of flowback by YES, and mutagenicity by AMES. The selective pressures of fracturing conditions (including toxicity) affected bacterial and archaeal communities, which were characterized by 16S rRNA gene V4V5 region sequencing. Conditions selected for thermophilic, anaerobic, halophilic bacteria and methanogenic archaea from the groundwater used for fracturing fluid, and from the native shale community. Trends in toxicity echoed the microbial community, which indicated distinct stages of early flowback water, a transition stage, and produced water. Biota in another sampled DJ Basin horizontal well resembled similarly aged samples from this well. However, microbial signatures were unique compared to samples from DJ Basin vertical wells, and wells from other basins. These data can inform treatability, reuse, and management decisions specific to the DJ Basin to minimize adverse environmental health and well production outcomes.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"644","issue":"","pages":"183-192","date":"December 10, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.067","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718321387","accessDate":"2018-07-17T18:28:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing","type":1},{"tag":"Flowback","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"In vitro bioassay","type":1},{"tag":"Produced water","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-17T18:28:05Z","dateModified":"2018-07-17T18:28:05Z"}},{"key":"S7HBWU5S","version":1592,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/S7HBWU5S","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/S7HBWU5S","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Nell and Helbling","parsedDate":"2018-05-17","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Nell, Marika, and Damian E.

Fluids injected into the subsurface return to the surface as wastewaters, which contain a complex mixture of additives, transformation products, and geogenic chemical constituents. Quantitative analytical methods are needed to evaluate wastewater disposal alternatives or to conduct adequate exposure assessments. However, our narrow understanding of how matrix effects change the ionization efficiency of target analytes limits the quantitative analysis of polar to semi-polar HF additives by means of liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). To address this limitation, we explored the ways in which matrix chemistry influences the ionization of seventeen priority HF additives with a modified standard addition approach. We then used the data to quantify HF additives in HF-associated fluids. Our results demonstrate that HF additives generally exhibit suppressed ionization in HF-associated fluids, though HF additives that predominantly form sodiated adducts exhibit significantly enhanced ionization in produced water samples, which is largely the result of adduct shifting. In a preliminary screening, we identified glutaraldehyde and 2-butoxyethanol along with homologues of benzalkonium chloride (ADBAC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polypropylene glycol (PPG) in HF-associated fluids. We then used matrix recovery factors to provide the first quantitative measurements of individual homologues of ADBAC, PEG, and PPG in HF-associated fluids ranging from mg L−1 levels in hydraulic fracturing fluid to low μg L−1 levels in PW samples. Our approach is generalizable across sample types and shale formations and yields important data to evaluate wastewater disposal alternatives or implement exposure assessments.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2018-05-17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Wellpads emitting methane and ethane in 2014 were far more likely to be emitting in 2015 than would expected by chance; Monte Carlo simulations suggest >5σ deviation (P<0.0001) from random assignment of detectable emissions between survey years. Scaled-up using basin-wide leakage estimates, the emissions quantified by aircraft are sufficient to explain previously observed basin-wide emissions of methane and ethane.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"July 10, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Using an emissions inventory for the oil and natural gas sector that reflects information regarding the level and distribution of PM2.5 and ozone precursor emissions, we simulate annual mean PM2.5 and summer season average daily 8 h maximum ozone concentrations with the Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with extensions (CAMx). We quantify the incidence and economic value of PM2.5 and ozone health related effects using the environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP). We find that ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone, and associated health impacts, are highest in a handful of states including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. On a per-ton basis, the benefits of reducing PM2.5 precursor emissions from this sector vary by pollutant species, and range from between $6,300 and $320,000, while the value of reducing ozone precursors ranges from $500 to $8,200 in the year 2025 (2015$).","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"July 13, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

We examine the effects of company size and ownership on revenue sharing outcomes in North Dakota (ND), drawing on political economy bargaining models. We examine firm-level characteristics of ND’s oil producers from 2005 to 2015, matching these data against revenue sharing outcomes and estimating effects using graphical and statistical methods. Along with this core analysis, we conduct key informant interviews with four elite actors in the unconventional oil and gas sector in ND, to provide supplementary details on industry structure and voluntary contributions to local communities. Our findings suggest that when industry is dominated by larger, publicly-traded firms, there is more revenue sharing between firms and the state government. However, we find anecdotal evidence that smaller, local firms may better target resources towards local needs. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the varied outcomes at the sub-national and sub-state level and expands the “resource curse” literature that suggests that industry characteristics shape local outcomes.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"44","issue":"","pages":"371-384","date":"October 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2018.05.006","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Why does industry structure matter for unconventional oil and gas development?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618304651","accessDate":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bargaining models","type":1},{"tag":"Industry structure","type":1},{"tag":"Revenue sharing","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z","dateModified":"2018-07-16T13:27:22Z"}},{"key":"ZX4A2SX4","version":1567,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/ZX4A2SX4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/ZX4A2SX4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Halliday et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Halliday, Hannah S., Anne M.

The measurements were carried out in July and August 2014 as part of NASA's “Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality” (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaign. The PTR-QMS data were supported by pressurized whole air canister samples and airborne vertical and horizontal surveys of VOCs. Unexpectedly high benzene mixing ratios were observed at PAO at ground level (mean benzene = 0.53 ppbv, maximum benzene = 29.3 ppbv), primarily at night (mean nighttime benzene = 0.73 ppbv). These high benzene levels were associated with southwesterly winds. The airborne measurements indicate that benzene originated from within the WGF, and typical source signatures detected in the canister samples implicate emissions from O&NG activities rather than urban vehicular emissions as primary benzene source. This conclusion is backed by a regional toluene-to-benzene ratio analysis which associated southerly flow with vehicular emissions from the Denver area. Weak benzene-to-CO correlations confirmed that traffic emissions were not responsible for the observed high benzene levels. Previous measurements at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) and our data obtained at PAO allow us to locate the source of benzene enhancements between the two atmospheric observatories. Fugitive emissions of benzene from O&NG operations in the Platteville area are discussed as the most likely causes of enhanced benzene levels at PAO.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"121","issue":"18","pages":"11,055-11,074","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2016JD025327","ISSN":"2169-8996","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JD025327","accessDate":"2018-07-11T18:03:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2016.

However, because of potential social and environmental drawbacks, including a lack of affordable housing and groundwater contamination from drilling, unconventional shale development is highly contentious in many areas and has resulted in many community conflicts. Hydraulic fracturing, which is a specific technology utilized in unconventional shale development, has proved especially contentious because of concerns about its long-term environmental consequences. Given the fast pace of shale development, coupled with the controversy that surrounds it, we seek to understand what factors affect a local government official's stance on shale development and hydraulic fracturing. To do this we draw from value-belief-norms theory while additionally examining knowledge and community-level factors that can influence an official's position. In this study, we survey 308 local government officials across six shale plays in the United States to examine local officials' positions on shale development and hydraulic fracturing. We find that the more positively officials perceive the consequences of shale development, the less likely they are to support banning hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, we find that networks to other shale communities are positively associated with favoring a ban. Further, leaders with a bachelor's degree or higher are more likely to favor a ban than those with lower than a bachelor's degree.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"80","issue":"4","pages":"397-430","date":"5/29/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12071","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ruso.12071","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:14:52Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2015, by the Rural Sociological Society","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:14:52Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:17:42Z"}},{"key":"G6S66DWM","version":1562,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/G6S66DWM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/G6S66DWM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Silva and Crowe","parsedDate":"2015-08-08","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Silva, Tony J., and Jessica A.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 officials before development occurred. Twelve supported introducing shale development to their communities, four were opposed, and two were undecided. Many view it as a way to overcome an economic vulnerability of their areas, population decline, by boosting the local population. Several also believe shale development will strengthen their communities’ economic specialization and social identity related to resource extraction. Although leaders held high hopes for it, most of their communities’ economic vulnerabilities are structural and likely cannot be improved by introducing shale development. This gap between hope and reality suggests that many community officials will be disappointed with major development projects – many of which are portrayed as economic boons – as they often cannot fulfill officials’ high hopes.","publicationTitle":"Community Development","volume":"46","issue":"4","pages":"312-328","date":"August 8, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/15575330.2015.1061678","ISSN":"1557-5330","shortTitle":"The hope-reality gap","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15575330.2015.1061678","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"rural economic development","type":1},{"tag":"shale development","type":1},{"tag":"unconventional shale development","type":1}],"collections":["EXLS3NV4","YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:15:18Z"}},{"key":"YUE8L4ZU","version":1555,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YUE8L4ZU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YUE8L4ZU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kroepsch","parsedDate":"2016-05-03","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kroepsch, Adrianne. &#x201C;New Rig on the Block: Spatial Policy Discourse and the New Suburban Geography of Energy Production on Colorado&#x2019;s Front Range.&#x201D; <i>Environmental Communication</i> 10, no. 3 (May 3, 2016): 337&#x2013;51. https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2015.1127852.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"YUE8L4ZU","version":1555,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"New rig on the block: spatial policy discourse and the new suburban geography of energy production on Colorado's Front Range","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adrianne","lastName":"Kroepsch"}],"abstractNote":"Drawing from the Critical Discourse Analysis and Cultural Sociology of Space frameworks, this empirical analysis explores the discursive struggle between stakeholders of divergent viewpoints as they respond to the newfound spatial proximity of oil and gas extraction to homes and schools in suburban residential areas on Colorado's northern Front Range. Through an analysis of media, policy-making, and neighborhood meeting discourse, this study examines the social construction of space through policy narratives and regional debates about the American West's relationship to extractive industries. Results reveal that the discursive struggle over suburban drilling hinges upon the question of whether industrial activities belong in residential areas and is carried out through competing policy narratives that invoke differing (spatial versus aspatial) policy solutions. The deliberative quality of these policy narratives is constrained by existing spatial policy practices and further constrains democratic engagement.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Communication","volume":"10","issue":"3","pages":"337-351","date":"May 3, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/17524032.2015.1127852","ISSN":"1752-4032","shortTitle":"New rig on the block","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2015.1127852","accessDate":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"American West","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"critical discourse analysis","type":1},{"tag":"cultural sociology of space","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"suburbs","type":1}],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:11:10Z"}},{"key":"268YEXBC","version":1606,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/268YEXBC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/268YEXBC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4977302,"username":"aldanagloria","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aldanagloria","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Raimi and Newell","parsedDate":"2017-12-20","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Raimi, Daniel, and Richard G.

This growth and subsequent contraction has affected local governments in dozens of regions. From 2013 to 2015, we conducted structured interviews with hundreds of local officials in 21 regions across 16 states, finding that most local governments had experienced net fiscal benefits from increased oil and gas development. We returned to five key regions (the Bakken, Denver-Julesburg, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, and Permian plays) in 2016 and 2017 to see whether and how the downturn had affected fiscal conditions for local governments. While effects varied depending on local factors, fiscal conditions have generally improved, with 82 percent of local governments reporting net positive fiscal effects, compared with 63 percent during our previous visits to these regions. However, managing revenue volatility has emerged as a major challenge for many local governments, and while economic diversification is a priority for most local officials, achieving this goal will be difficult, particularly for rural communities that are or have become heavily dependent on the oil and gas sector.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"December 20, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/local-fiscal-effects-drilling-downturn-local-government-impacts-decreased-oil","accessDate":"2018-07-09","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["EXLS3NV4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:51:50Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:51:50Z"}},{"key":"W9LGEJBG","version":1553,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/W9LGEJBG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/W9LGEJBG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bills Walsh and Haggerty","parsedDate":"2017-02","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bills Walsh, Kathryn, and Julia H.

This paper evaluates an experimental approach to monitoring and mitigating social and economic impacts of HVHF development in Wyoming, USA between 2005 and 2009. The goal of the analysis is to assess how HVHF development in a rural setting creates unique opportunities and challenges for community-based and participatory planning and impact assessment approaches. Using archival data, oral history transcripts, and interviews, we conclude that a community-based approach can be effective as a response to HVHF development, provided there is adequate scaffolding in the form of technical and financial assistance and supporting metagovernance. We also observe that the intensity of HVHF development creates special problems that surface as strained relationships and limited capacity among key stakeholders such as local government officials, their staff, and their constituents. Well-supported community-based and participatory processes to social and economic impact assessment that encourage social learning, inclusive deliberation with transparency, and accountability can mitigate these problems, but require extensive political and administrative support to do so.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Rural Studies","volume":"43","issue":"","pages":"235-247","date":"February 1, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Rural Studies","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.11.005","ISSN":"0743-0167","shortTitle":"Does local monitoring empower fracking host communities?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016715300413","accessDate":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community","type":1},{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"Governance","type":1},{"tag":"Oil and gas development","type":1},{"tag":"Social impact assessment","type":1}],"collections":["F8Q5D6RS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:25:53Z"}},{"key":"3M68Q2FR","version":1725,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3M68Q2FR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3M68Q2FR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick et al.","parsedDate":"2017-06-23","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Krupnick, Alan J., Isabel Echarte, and Lucija Anna Muehlenbachs. &#x201C;Local Government Impacts of Unconventional Oil and Gas Development.&#x201D; Washingto, D.C.: Resources for the Future Report, June 23, 2017. http://www.rff.org/research/publications/local-government-impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-development.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"3M68Q2FR","version":1725,"itemType":"report","title":"Local Government Impacts of Unconventional Oil and Gas Development","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alan J.","lastName":"Krupnick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Echarte"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lucija Anna","lastName":"Muehlenbachs"}],"abstractNote":"This report reviews the academic literature analyzing the effect of unconventional oil and gas development on local public finance outcomes including a review on the truck traffic literature, a specific subset of these local government outcomes.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"Washingto, D.C.","institution":"Resources for the Future Report","date":"June 23, 2017","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/local-government-impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-development","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["6XUSFNEU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-09T13:00:54Z","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:02:27Z"}},{"key":"TUN533EI","version":1533,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TUN533EI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TUN533EI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pierce et al.","parsedDate":"2018-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Pierce, Jonathan J., Hilary Boudet, Chad Zanocco, and Megan Hillyard. &#x201C;Analyzing the Factors That Influence U.S. Public Support for Exporting Natural Gas.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 120 (September 1, 2018): 666&#x2013;74. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.066.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"TUN533EI","version":1533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing the factors that influence U.S. public support for exporting natural gas","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan J.","lastName":"Pierce"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Boudet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Zanocco"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Hillyard"}],"abstractNote":"The U.S. is now the global leader in natural gas production. The federal government is changing policies and priorities to expand natural gas export to foreign energy markets. Such an expansion requires increased pipeline capacity and the development of export terminals for shipping. While natural gas export is a burgeoning energy and environmental issue, we know little about what influences public support/opposition for the practice. Such information is vital to all levels of government and stakeholders. Using a national online survey sample (n = 1042), we examine what factors influence public support/opposition. Results of regression analysis indicate that supporters tend to be male, hold a bachelor's degree or higher, wealthier, politically conservative, and reference affective images of the economy, energy, and trade. In contrast, opponents tend to be women, politically liberal, and reference affective images related to keeping natural gas in the U.S., the environment, and hydraulic fracturing. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for energy policy, public communication about this issue, and future research.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"666-674","date":"September 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.066","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518303835","accessDate":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy policy","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Risk communication","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z","dateModified":"2018-07-03T16:38:02Z"}},{"key":"SYLI4V8A","version":1523,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SYLI4V8A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SYLI4V8A","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bell et al.","parsedDate":"2017-12-27","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bell, Clay, Timothy Vaughn, Daniel Zimmerle, Scott Herndon, Tara Yacovitch, Garvin Heath, Gabrielle P&#xE9;tron, et al. &#x201C;Comparison of Methane Emission Estimates from Multiple Measurement Techniques at Natural Gas Production Pads.&#x201D; <i>Elem Sci Anth</i> 5, no. 0 (December 27, 2017). https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.266.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"SYLI4V8A","version":1523,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Comparison of methane emission estimates from multiple measurement techniques at natural gas production pads","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Clay","lastName":"Bell"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Vaughn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Zimmerle"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Herndon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Yacovitch"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Garvin","lastName":"Heath"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gabrielle","lastName":"Pétron"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Edie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Field"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Murphy"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Soltis"}],"abstractNote":"Article: Comparison of methane emission estimates from multiple measurement techniques at natural gas production pads","publicationTitle":"Elem Sci Anth","volume":"5","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"2017-12-27","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1525/elementa.266","ISSN":"2325-1026","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.266/","accessDate":"2018-06-26T13:46:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.elementascience.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

Eighteen source categories were estimated using multiple data sets, including new empirical measurements at regional O&G sites and a national study of gathering and processing facilities. Spatially referenced activity data were compiled from federal and state databases and combined with O&G facility emission factors calculated using Monte Carlo simulations that account for high emission sites representing the very upper portion, or fat-tail, in the observed emissions distributions. Total methane emissions in the 25-county Barnett Shale region in October 2013 were estimated to be 72,300 (63,400–82,400) kg CH4 h–1. O&G emissions were estimated to be 46,200 (40,000–54,100) kg CH4 h–1 with 19% of emissions from fat-tail sites representing less than 2% of sites. Our estimate of O&G emissions in the Barnett Shale region was higher than alternative inventories based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Inventory, EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research by factors of 1.5, 2.7, and 4.3, respectively. Gathering compressor stations, which accounted for 40% of O&G emissions in our inventory, had the largest difference from emission estimates based on EPA data sources. Our inventory’s higher O&G emission estimate was due primarily to its more comprehensive activity factors and inclusion of emissions from fat-tail sites.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8147-8157","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1021/es506359c","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-23T12:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-06-23T12:32:27Z"}},{"key":"BKJXDHKJ","version":1518,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BKJXDHKJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BKJXDHKJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Alvarez et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Alvarez, Ram&#xF3;n A., Daniel Zavala-Araiza, David R.

When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 Tg/y, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. EPA inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO2 from natural gas combustion. Significant emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"eaar7204","date":"2018/06/21","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aar7204","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/06/20/science.aar7204","accessDate":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2018, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 29930092","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z","dateModified":"2018-06-22T12:46:55Z"}},{"key":"KX2CNYPF","version":1515,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KX2CNYPF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KX2CNYPF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kassotis et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-21","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kassotis, Christopher D., Susan C.

This wastewater is typically disposed of via injecting into disposal wells for long-term storage, treatment and discharge from wastewater treatment plants, and/or storage in open evaporation pits; however, wastewater spill rates are reported at 2–20% of active well sites across regions, increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of these wastewaters. This study assessed adipogenic activity (both triglyceride accumulation and pre-adipocyte proliferation) for a mixture of 23 commonly used UOG chemicals and a small subset of UOG wastewater-impacted surface water extracts from Colorado and West Virginia, using 3T3-L1 cells and a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) reporter assay. We report potent and efficacious adipogenic activity induced by both a laboratory-created UOG chemical mixture and UOG-impacted water samples at concentrations below environmental levels. We further report activation of PPARγ at similar concentrations for some samples, suggesting a causative molecular pathway for the observed effects, but not for other adipogenic samples, implicating PPARγ-dependent and independent effects from UOG associated chemicals. Taken together, these results suggest that UOG wastewater has the potential to impact metabolic health at environmentally relevant concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"June 21, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.030","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718316620","accessDate":"2018-06-21T13:27:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Adipogenesis","type":1},{"tag":"Endocrine disrupting chemicals","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Metabolic disruption","type":1},{"tag":"Obesity","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-21T13:27:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-21T13:27:34Z"}},{"key":"MP5FDKHP","version":1512,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MP5FDKHP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MP5FDKHP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barth-Naftilan et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-13","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Barth-Naftilan, E., J.

These concerns motivated our 2-year prospective study of groundwater quality within the Marcellus Shale. We installed eight multilevel monitoring wells within bedrock aquifers of a 25-km2 area targeted for shale gas development (SGD). Twenty-four isolated intervals within these wells were sampled monthly over 2 years and groundwater pressures were recorded before, during, and after seven shale gas wells were drilled, hydraulically fractured, and placed into production. Perturbations in groundwater pressures were detected at hilltop monitoring wells during drilling of nearby gas wells and during a gas well casing breach. In both instances, pressure changes were ephemeral (<24 hours) and no lasting impact on groundwater quality was observed. Overall, methane concentrations ([CH4]) ranged from detection limit to 70 mg/L, increased with aquifer depth, and, at several sites, exhibited considerable temporal variability. Methane concentrations in valley monitoring wells located above gas well laterals increased in conjunction with SGD, but CH4 isotopic composition and hydrocarbon composition (CH4/C2H6) are inconsistent with Marcellus origins for this gas. Further, salinity increased concurrently with [CH4], which rules out contamination by gas phase migration of fugitive methane from structurally compromised gas wells. Collectively, our observations suggest that SGD was an unlikely source of methane in our valley wells, and that naturally occurring methane in valley settings, where regional flow systems interact with local flow systems, is more variable in concentration and composition both temporally and spatially than previously understood.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"201720898","date":"2018/06/13","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1720898115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/12/1720898115","accessDate":"2018-06-20T14:05:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

A significant portion of this increase has come from output in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania. This output has altered gas markets and repositioned Pennsylvania as a major gas exporter. It has also put Pennsylvania at odds with other states as it is one of a few without a formal severance tax on extractive resources. In this paper, we combine results from a structural demand model with a two-sector trade model to analyze the interstate welfare impacts of Pennsylvania's current severance tax proposal. Our results demonstrate that most of the welfare losses from this proposed policy are likely to be shifted to residents in other states. We also demonstrate how fluctuations in gas prices can substantially reduce tax revenue. These findings have important implications for both Pennsylvania and U.S. energy policy given the significant rise in energy production from new sources throughout the U.S.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"53-65","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.05.002","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Unconventional energy, taxation, and interstate welfare","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301695","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Energy demand","type":1},{"tag":"Tax shifting","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional energy","type":1},{"tag":"Welfare","type":1}],"collections":["APRI3VMZ","9IL3TCKF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:54:33Z"}},{"key":"YXBHVF35","version":1502,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YXBHVF35","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YXBHVF35","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Creason et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Creason, Jared R., John E.

This paper focuses on the effects of technology and market assumptions with projections out to 2050. A total of 15 models contributed projections based on a set of standardized scenarios. The scenarios include a range of assumptions about the price of natural gas, costs of end-use energy efficiency, retirements of nuclear power, the cost of renewable electricity, and overall electricity demand. The range of models and scenarios represent similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of analytical methods. One similarity across almost all results from all models and scenarios is that the share of electricity generation and capacity fueled by coal shrinks over time, although the rate at which coal capacity is retired depends on the price of natural gas and the amount of electricity that is demanded. Another similarity is that the models project average increases in natural gas power generating capacity in every scenario over the 2020–2050 period, but at lower average annual rates than those that prevailed during the 2000–2015 period. The projections also include higher gas capacity utilization rates in the 2035–2050 period compared to the 2020–2050 period in every scenario, except the high gas price sensitivity. Renewables capacity is also projected to increase in every scenario, although the annual new capacity varies from modest rates below the observed 2000–2015 wind and solar average to rates more than 3 times that high. Model estimates of CO2 emissions largely follow from the trends in generation. Low renewables cost and low gas prices both result in lower overall CO2 emission rates relative to the 2020–2035 and 2035–2050 reference. Both limited nuclear lifetimes and higher demand result in increased CO2 emissions.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"290-306","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.04.013","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Effects of technology assumptions on US power sector capacity, generation and emissions projections","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301385","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Electric sector","type":1},{"tag":"Energy-economic modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Model intercomparison","type":1},{"tag":"Technology","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:51:14Z"}},{"key":"TNVMAQVI","version":1502,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TNVMAQVI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TNVMAQVI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bistline et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bistline, John E., Elke Hodson, Charles G.

Harmonized policy scenarios (including mass-based emissions limits and various power-sector-only carbon tax trajectories) across 16 models provide comparative assessments of potential impacts on electric sector investment and generation outcomes, emissions reductions, and economic implications. This paper compares results across these policy alternatives, including a variety of technological and natural gas price assumptions, and summarizes robust findings and areas of disagreement across participating models. Under a wide range of policy, technology, and market assumptions, model results suggest that future coal generation will decline relative to current levels while generation from natural gas, wind, and solar will increase, though the pace and extent of these changes vary by policy scenario, technological assumptions, region, and model. Climate policies can amplify trends already under way and make them less susceptible to future market changes. The model results provide useful insights to a range of stakeholders, but future research focused on intersectoral linkages in emission reductions (e.g., the role of electrification), effects of energy storage, and better coverage of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can improve insights even further.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"73","issue":"","pages":"307-325","date":"June 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.04.012","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Electric sector policy, technological change, and U.S. emissions reductions goals","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318301373","accessDate":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"Electric sector","type":1},{"tag":"Energy-economic modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Market-based environmental policy","type":1},{"tag":"Model intercomparison","type":1},{"tag":"Technology","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-20T13:51:02Z"}},{"key":"8IB6VDUV","version":3479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8IB6VDUV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8IB6VDUV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Murray et al.","parsedDate":"2018-06-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Some attribute the decline to increased oil production due to the U.S. shale revolution. This paper proposes a variety of diagnostics to assess the how consistent this explanation is with the data. I find that the data are broadly inconsistent with this attribution of the decline to shale oil. Rather, the data are more consistent with a demand-side explanation of weakening global economic conditions and demand for commodities, including but not limited to oil. In summary, there is no evidence that the U.S. shale revolution played a significant role in the decline in oil prices since 2014. Rather, the evidence suggests that weakening oil demand played a much stronger role in driving the 2014 decline in oil prices.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"74","issue":"","pages":"63-75","date":"August 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.05.029","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"Explanations for the 2014 oil price decline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318302020","accessDate":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Crude oil prices","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Shale oil","type":1},{"tag":"Tight oil","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:36:15Z"}},{"key":"R5VFSS7R","version":1495,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R5VFSS7R","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R5VFSS7R","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gilbert and Sovacool","parsedDate":"2018-09","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gilbert, Alexander Q., and Benjamin K.

Using bounding scenarios of attributional lifecycle analysis, this study finds that the climate impacts of United States exports to China, Japan, India, or South Korea could vary significantly, with annual global lifecycle emissions ranging from −88,000 metric tons CO2e to + 170,000 metric tons CO2e per Bcf of exports. Exact emissions will depend on factors such as (a) the final end-use of the LNG, (b) domestic market impacts from increased natural gas prices in the United States, (c) induced additional energy consumption in importing countries, and (d) methane leakage rates. Country specific greenhouse gas outcomes can differ from global outcomes, with major implications for extraction and consumption based emissions accounting. The study's results indicate the need for more robust consideration of the climate impacts of all energy exports in terms of country specific energy analyses, global climate regulations, and market uncertainty. Thus, how gas is governed becomes of critical importance, for it will determine whether LNG is a net sink or source of additional emissions.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"120","issue":"","pages":"635-643","date":"September 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Carbon pathways in the global gas market","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518303793","accessDate":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Attributional lifecycle analysis (ACLA)","type":1},{"tag":"Energy exports","type":1},{"tag":"LNG trade","type":1},{"tag":"Lifecycle analysis (LCA)","type":1},{"tag":"Liquefied natural gas (LNG)","type":1},{"tag":"Methane leakage","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z","dateModified":"2018-06-15T13:13:17Z"}},{"key":"M9RPUDN9","version":1486,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/M9RPUDN9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/M9RPUDN9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Krupnick et al.","parsedDate":"2013-07-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Krupnick, Alan, Zhongmin Wang, and Yushuang Wang. &#x201C;Sector Effects of the Shale Gas Revolution in the United States.&#x201D; SSRN Scholarly Paper.

Natural gas is being substituted for other fuels, particularly coal, in electricity generation, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. The use of natural gas in the transportation sector is currently negligible but is projected to increase with investments in refueling infrastructure and natural gas vehicle technologies. Petrochemical and other manufacturing industries have responded to lower natural gas prices by investing in domestically located manufacturing projects. This paper also speculates on the impact of a possible shale gas boom in China.","reportNumber":"ID 2296080","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2013/07/19","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2296080","accessDate":"2018-06-13T18:42:23Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"electricity","type":1},{"tag":"manufacturing","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"transportation","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T18:42:23Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T18:42:23Z"}},{"key":"KCX6PAY2","version":1478,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KCX6PAY2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KCX6PAY2","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Tasker et al.","parsedDate":"2018-05-30","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Tasker, T.

In this study, the potential environmental and human health impacts of this practice are evaluated. Analyses of O&G wastewaters spread on roads in the northeastern, U.S. show that these wastewaters have salt, radioactivity, and organic contaminant concentrations often many times above drinking water standards. Bioassays also indicated that these wastewaters contain organic micropollutants that affected signaling pathways consistent with xenobiotic metabolism and caused toxicity to aquatic organisms like Daphnia magna. The potential toxicity of these wastewaters is a concern as lab experiments demonstrated that nearly all of the metals from these wastewaters leach from roads after rain events, likely reaching ground and surface water. Release of a known carcinogen (e.g., radium) from roads treated with O&G wastewaters has been largely ignored. In Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2014, spreading O&G wastewater on roads released over 4 times more radium to the environment (320 millicuries) than O&G wastewater treatment facilities and 200 times more radium than spill events. Currently, state-by-state regulations do not require radium analyses prior to treating roads with O&G wastewaters. Methods for reducing the potential impacts of spreading O&G wastewaters on roads are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 30, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Extraction of shale oil and shale gas is generally performed through water-intensive hydraulic fracturing. Despite recent work on its environmental impacts, it remains unclear where and to what extent shale resource extraction could compete with other water needs. Here we consider the global distribution of known shale deposits suitable for oil and gas extraction and develop a water balance model to quantify their impacts on local water availability for other human uses and ecosystem functions. We find that 31–44% of the world's shale deposits are located in areas where water stress would either emerge or be exacerbated as a result of shale oil or gas extraction; 20% of shale deposits are in areas affected by groundwater depletion and 30% in irrigated land. In these regions shale oil and shale gas production would likely compete for local water resources with agriculture, environmental flows, and other water needs. By adopting a hydrologic perspective that considers water availability and demand together, decision makers and local communities can better understand the water and food security implications of shale resource development.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2018EF000809","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"The Water-Energy Nexus of Hydraulic Fracturing","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2018EF000809","accessDate":"2018-06-11T14:00:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"©2018.

However, not all regions experience the same degree of coal-to-gas generation switching or electricity price declines. Specifically, regions experiencing more coal-to-gas switching experience smaller electricity price drops. We provide intuition that may explain this pattern. This finding also has environmental and welfare consequences: coal-fired plants emit more pollutants, and therefore regions that benefit more from greater emissions reductions experience lower benefits from declining electricity prices.

Here we present a data set of δ2H?CH4 measurements of individual sources and air in the Colorado Front Range, USA. We show that δ2H?CH4, but not δ13C, signatures are consistent in air sampled downwind of landfills, cattle feedlots, and oil and gas wells in the region. Applying these source signatures to air in ground and aircraft samples indicates that at least 50% of CH4 emitted in the region is biogenic, perhaps because regulatory restrictions on leaking oil and natural gas wells are helping to reduce this source of CH4. Source apportionment tracers such as δ2H may help close the gap between CH4 observations and inventories, which may underestimate biogenic as well as thermogenic sources.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"21","pages":"11,462-11,471","date":"October 28, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Geophysical Research Letters","language":"","DOI":"10.1002/2016GL071438","ISSN":"0094-8276","shortTitle":"Using stable isotopes of hydrogen to quantify biogenic and thermogenic atmospheric methane sources","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL071438","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:26:29Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"cattle","type":1},{"tag":"landfill","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"stable isotopes","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:26:30Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:26:30Z"}},{"key":"H2MJH6F4","version":1460,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/H2MJH6F4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/H2MJH6F4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Townsend‐Small Amy et al.","parsedDate":"2016-02-20","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Townsend&#x2010;Small Amy, Ferrara Thomas W., Lyon David R., Fries Anastasia E., and Lamb Brian K. &#x201C;Emissions of Coalbed and Natural Gas Methane from Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells in the United States.&#x201D; <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> 43, no. 5 (February 20, 2016): 2283&#x2013;90. https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067623.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"H2MJH6F4","version":1460,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Emissions of coalbed and natural gas methane from abandoned oil and gas wells in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Townsend‐Small Amy"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Ferrara Thomas W."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Lyon David R."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Fries Anastasia E."},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Lamb Brian K."}],"abstractNote":"Abstract Recent work indicates that oil and gas methane (CH4) inventories for the United States are underestimated. Here we present results from direct measurements of CH4 emissions from 138 abandoned oil and gas wells, a source currently missing from inventories. Most abandoned wells do not emit CH4, but 6.5% of wells had measurable CH4 emissions. Twenty?five percent of wells we visited that had not been plugged emitted?>?5?g?CH4?h?1. Stable isotopes indicate that wells emit natural gas and/or coalbed CH4. We estimate that abandoned wells make a small contribution (<1%) to regional CH4 emissions in our study areas. Additional data are needed to accurately determine the contribution of abandoned wells to national CH4 budgets, particularly measurements in other basins and better characterization of the abundance and regional distribution of high emitters.","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"43","issue":"5","pages":"2283-2290","date":"February 20, 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Geophysical Research Letters","language":"","DOI":"10.1002/2015GL067623","ISSN":"0094-8276","shortTitle":"","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067623","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"abandoned wells","type":1},{"tag":"emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:24:39Z"}},{"key":"9KAFYTEF","version":1457,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9KAFYTEF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9KAFYTEF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Townsend-Small et al.","parsedDate":"2015-07-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Townsend-Small, Amy, Josette E.

Identifying fingerprints of these emissions is critical to our understanding of potential impacts. Here, we compare stable isotopic and alkane ratio tracers of natural gas, agricultural, and urban CH4 sources in the Barnett Shale hydraulic fracturing region near Fort Worth, Texas. Thermogenic and biogenic sources were compositionally distinct, and emissions from oil wells were enriched in alkanes and isotopically depleted relative to natural gas wells. Emissions from natural gas production varied in δ13C and alkane ratio composition, with δD-CH4 representing the most consistent tracer of natural gas sources. We integrated our data into a bottom-up inventory of CH4 for the region, resulting in an inventory of ethane (C2H6) sources for comparison to top-down estimates of CH4 and C2H6 emissions. Methane emissions in the Barnett are a complex mixture of urban, agricultural, and fossil fuel sources, which makes source apportionment challenging. For example, spatial heterogeneity in gas composition and high C2H6/CH4 ratios in emissions from conventional oil production add uncertainty to top-down models of source apportionment. Future top-down studies may benefit from the addition of δD-CH4 to distinguish thermogenic and biogenic sources.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"49","issue":"13","pages":"8175-8182","date":"July 7, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The frequency of these incidents is not well known, particularly at modern sites that increasingly use advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this work is to determine the rate of fires and explosions at O&G sites in Colorado and Utah and apply this information to evaluate the proximity of these incidents to residences. Between 2006 and 2015, a total of 116 fires and explosions in Colorado (0.03% of active wells) and 67 fires or explosions in Utah (0.07% of active wells) were reported at O&G operations. The higher percentage of fires or explosions per number of active wells in Utah compared to Colorado (Rate Ratio=2.49, p<0.01) is likely influenced by the mandatory self-reporting requirements in Utah and the more lenient self-reporting in Colorado. The average number of residences within 1609m of the reported incident was 31 (median=3, SD=131) in the Denver Julesburg Basin and 4 (median=0, SD=10) in the Piceance Basin of Colorado. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of fires and explosions at O&G sites and offers insight into the rate and reporting of these events.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"29","issue":"","pages":"36-43","date":"July 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Research & Social Science","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2017.04.014","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"Is reporting “significant damage” transparent?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629617301081","accessDate":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Explosions","type":1},{"tag":"Fire","type":1},{"tag":"Gas","type":1},{"tag":"Mandatory reporting","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Risk","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T16:20:32Z"}},{"key":"SKB9ASHD","version":1451,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SKB9ASHD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SKB9ASHD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Allshouse et al.","parsedDate":"2017-09-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Allshouse, William B., John L.

Health studies have relied on proximity to O&G wells as an exposure metric, typically using an inverse distance-weighting (IDW) approach. Because O&G emissions are dependent on multiple factors, a dynamic model is needed to describe the variability in air pollution emissions over space and time. We used information on Colorado O&G activities, production volumes, and air pollutant emission rates from two Colorado basins to create a spatiotemporal industrial activity model to develop an intensity-adjusted IDW well-count metric. The Spearman correlation coefficient between this metric and measured pollutant concentrations was 0.74. We applied our model to households in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the middle of the densely developed Denver–Julesburg basin. Our intensity-adjusted IDW increased the unadjusted IDW dynamic range by a factor of 19 and distinguishes high-intensity events, such as hydraulic fracturing and flowback, from lower-intensity events, such as production at single-well pads. As the frequency of multiwell pads increases, it will become increasingly important to characterize the range of intensities at O&G sites when conducting epidemiological studies.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"51","issue":"17","pages":"10243-10250","date":"September 5, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Simulation experiments indicate that combined-cycle generation raises the long-run price of natural gas, both at the wellhead and electricity generating plants. Conversely, the increased production of natural gas has a relatively small long-run effect on natural gas prices. Historical counterfactuals indicate increased natural gas production since June 2003 lowers natural gas prices by an average of $0.16 per million BTU while combined cycle generation increases prices by an average of $0.54 per million BTU since April 1999. This increase is captured by natural gas producers such that the margin between prices at electricity generating plants and the wellhead shrinks by about $0.05 per million BTU. This analysis suggests that market relations among energy prices and their statistical ordering will reinforce the direct effects of a carbon tax on relative prices in ways that enhance interfuel substitution towards natural gas.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"118","issue":"","pages":"603-611","date":"July 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.039","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"The effects of combined-cycle generation and hydraulic fracturing on the price for coal, oil, and natural gas","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518301721","accessDate":"2018-05-23T14:51:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Carbon taxes","type":1},{"tag":"Combined cycle technology","type":1},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas prices","type":1},{"tag":"Oil prices","type":1}],"collections":["SFLUS5I4","42H54TQS","4NPI3GYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-23T14:51:17Z","dateModified":"2018-05-23T14:51:17Z"}},{"key":"F5DDFKRF","version":1445,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/F5DDFKRF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/F5DDFKRF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Grubert and Sanders","parsedDate":"2018-05-08","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Grubert, Emily, and Kelly T.

To support resource comanagement and fill this noted gap in the literature, this work presents detailed estimates for US-based water consumption and withdrawals for the US energy system as of 2014, including both intensity values and the first known estimate of total water consumption and withdrawal by the US energy system. We address 126 unit processes, many of which are new additions to the literature, differentiated among 17 fuel cycles, five life cycle stages, three water source categories, and four levels of water quality. Overall coverage is about 99% of commercially traded US primary energy consumption with detailed energy flows by unit process. Energy-related water consumption, or water removed from its source and not directly returned, accounts for about 10% of both total and freshwater US water consumption. Major consumers include biofuels (via irrigation), oil (via deep well injection, usually of nonfreshwater), and hydropower (via evaporation and seepage). The US energy system also accounts for about 40% of both total and freshwater US water withdrawals, i.e., water removed from its source regardless of fate. About 70% of withdrawals are associated with the once-through cooling systems of approximately 300 steam cycle power plants that produce about 25% of US electricity.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"May 8, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Previous studies have shown that natural gas methane (CH4) is present in groundwater near shale gas wells in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania, but did not have pre-drilling baseline measurements. Here, we present the results of a free public water testing program in the Utica Shale of Ohio, where we measured CH4 concentration, CH4 stable isotopic composition, and pH and conductivity along temporal and spatial gradients of hydraulic fracturing activity. Dissolved CH4 ranged from 0.2 μg/L to 25 mg/L, and stable isotopic measurements indicated a predominantly biogenic carbonate reduction CH4 source. Radiocarbon dating of CH4 in combination with stable isotopic analysis of CH4 in three samples indicated that fossil C substrates are the source of CH4 in groundwater, with one 14C date indicative of modern biogenic carbonate reduction. We found no relationship between CH4 concentration or source in groundwater and proximity to active gas well sites. No significant changes in CH4 concentration, CH4 isotopic composition, pH, or conductivity in water wells were observed during the study period. These data indicate that high levels of biogenic CH4 can be present in groundwater wells independent of hydraulic fracturing activity and affirm the need for isotopic or other fingerprinting techniques for CH4 source identification. Continued monitoring of private drinking water wells is critical to ensure that groundwater quality is not altered as hydraulic fracturing activity continues in the region.

With technological advances, hydraulic fracturing is now widely used to initiate oil and gas production in unconventional (low-permeability) oil and gas formations that were previously inaccessible. This process now is used in more than 90% of new oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is done after a well is drilled and involves injecting large volumes of water, sand (or other propping agent), and specialized chemicals under enough pressure to fracture the formations holding the oil or gas. The sand or other proppant holds the fractures open to allow the oil or gas to flow freely out of the formation and into a production well. Its application, along with horizontal drilling, for production of natural gas (methane) from tight gas sands, unconventional shale formations, and coal beds, has resulted in the marked expansion of estimated U.S. natural gas reserves in recent years. Similarly, hydraulic fracturing is enabling the development of tight oil resources, such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations. The rapid growth in the use of fracturing has raised concerns over its potential impacts on groundwater and drinking water sources, and has led to calls for more state and/or federal oversight of this activity.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"43","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T17:08:35Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T17:08:35Z"}},{"key":"MEBTATLY","version":1412,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/MEBTATLY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/MEBTATLY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">&#x201C;Follow the Oil.&#x201D; Accessed May 7, 2018. http://westernpriorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CFWPreport_030513_v9.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"MEBTATLY","version":1412,"itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Follow the Oil","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:49:58Z","url":"http://westernpriorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CFWPreport_030513_v9.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Follow the Oil.pdf","md5":"e5e002484233e0bad70736b5a3327a22","mtime":1525711803216,"tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:49:58Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:50:03Z"}},{"key":"XJYH88PD","version":1408,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/XJYH88PD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/XJYH88PD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"University","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">University, Quinnipiac. &#x201C;Quinnipiac University Poll March 2013.&#x201D; QU Poll.

Of the 198 possible examples, magnitudes range up to 7.9. The potential causes and magnitudes are (a) mining (M 1.6–5.6); (b) oil and gas field depletion (M 1.0–7.3); (c) water injection for secondary oil recovery (M 1.9–5.1); (d) reservoir impoundment (M 2.0–7.9); (e) waste disposal (M 2.0–5.3); (f) academic research boreholes investigating induced seismicity and stress (M 2.8–3.1); (g) solution mining (M 1.0–5.2); (h) geothermal operations (M 1.0–4.6) and (i) hydraulic fracturing for recovery of gas and oil from low-permeability sedimentary rocks (M 1.0–3.8). Reactivation of faults and resultant seismicity occurs due to a reduction in effective stress on fault planes. Hydraulic fracturing operations can trigger seismicity because it can cause an increase in the fluid pressure in a fault zone. Based upon the research compiled here we propose that this could occur by three mechanisms. Firstly, fracturing fluid or displaced pore fluid could enter the fault. Secondly, there may be direct connection with the hydraulic fractures and a fluid pressure pulse could be transmitted to the fault. Lastly, due to poroelastic properties of rock, deformation or ‘inflation’ due to hydraulic fracturing could increase fluid pressure in the fault or in fractures connected to the fault. The following pathways for fluid or a fluid pressure pulse are proposed: (a) directly from the wellbore; (b) through new, stimulated hydraulic fractures; (c) through pre-existing fractures and minor faults; or (d) through the pore network of permeable beds or along bedding planes. The reactivated fault could be intersected by the wellbore or it could be 10s to 100s of metres from it. We propose these mechanisms have been responsible for the three known examples of felt seismicity that are probably induced by hydraulic fracturing. These are in the USA, Canada and the UK. The largest such earthquake was M 3.8 and was in the Horn River Basin, Canada. To date, hydraulic fracturing has been a relatively benign mechanism compared to other anthropogenic triggers, probably because of the low volumes of fluid and short pumping times used in hydraulic fracturing operations. These data and analysis should help provide useful context and inform the current debate surrounding hydraulic fracturing technology.","publicationTitle":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","volume":"45","issue":"","pages":"171-185","date":"August 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Marine and Petroleum Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.03.016","ISSN":"0264-8172","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817213000846","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Earthquake","type":1},{"tag":"Fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"Induced","type":1},{"tag":"Seismic","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:43:25Z"}},{"key":"GQL77LXP","version":1386,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GQL77LXP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GQL77LXP","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ratner et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ratner, Michael, Paul W Parfomak, Ian F Fergusson, and Linda Luther. &#x201C;U.S. Natural Gas Exports: New Opportunities, Uncertain Outcomes,&#x201D; n.d., 30.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"GQL77LXP","version":1386,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"U.S. Natural Gas Exports: New Opportunities, Uncertain Outcomes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ratner"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Paul W","lastName":"Parfomak"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ian F","lastName":"Fergusson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Luther"}],"abstractNote":"As estimates for the amount of U.S. natural gas resources have grown, so have the prospects of rising U.S. natural gas exports. The United States is expected to go from a net importer of natural gas to a net exporter by 2020. Projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) by tanker ship have been proposed—cumulatively accounting for about 12.5% of current U.S. natural gas production—and are at varying stages of regulatory approval. Projects require federal approval under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. §717b), with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission being the lead authorizing agencies. Pipeline exports, which accounted for 94% of all exports of U.S. produced natural gas in 2010, are also likely to rise.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"30","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:42:44Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:42:44Z"}},{"key":"86UMNS6Z","version":1380,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/86UMNS6Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/86UMNS6Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gaswirth et al.","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gaswirth, Stephanie B., Kristen R.

This report responds to a discovery of potentially massive deposits beneath the Marcellus Shale and a series of related issues concerning the economy, environmental protection, and public safety. The findings are drawn from an October 2011 telephone survey conducted by the Muhlenberg Institute of Public Opinion, in collaboration with the University of Michigan Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy. This survey secured responses from 525 residents of the state, drawn from all regions and comprising a statistically-representative profile of citizens. It examines general public attitudes on this issue as well as consideration of a series of policy options that have been introduced in state and local government circles.","reportNumber":"ID 2313288","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2011/11/01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Fracking for Natural Gas","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2313288","accessDate":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"CLOSUP","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"climate change","type":1},{"tag":"energy","type":1},{"tag":"environment","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"national surveys on energy and environment","type":1},{"tag":"survey","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:11:59Z"}},{"key":"8U4ZRTMW","version":1302,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8U4ZRTMW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8U4ZRTMW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"AVALOS and BURNETT","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">AVALOS, MONA, and DAVID B BURNETT. &#x201C;Public Perception of Desalinated Produced Water From Oil and Gas Filed Operations: A Replication,&#x201D; n.d., 15.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"8U4ZRTMW","version":1302,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Public Perception of Desalinated Produced Water From Oil and Gas Filed Operations: A Replication","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"MONA","lastName":"AVALOS"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"DAVID B","lastName":"BURNETT"}],"abstractNote":"This study is a replication of Theodori et al.’s (2009) research on public perception of desalinated produced water from oil and gas field operations. The data used in this paper were collected in twelve Texas counties. Overall, the findings of this investigation paralleled those uncovered in Theodori et al.’s original exploration. Our data reveal that small percentages of respondents are extremely familiar with the process of desalination and extremely confident that desalinated water could meet human drinking water quality and purity standards. Our data also indicate that respondents are more favorably disposed toward the use of desalinated water for purposes where the probability of human or animal ingestion is lessened. Lastly, our data show that individuals with higher levels of familiarity with the process of desalination were more likely than those with lower levels of familiarity to agree that desalinated water from oil and gas field operations could safely be used for each of nine proposed purposes. Possible implications of these findings are advanced.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"15","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T16:11:36Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T16:11:44Z"}},{"key":"NK8C4RKK","version":1302,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NK8C4RKK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NK8C4RKK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Theodori and Jackson-Smith","parsedDate":"2010-01-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Theodori, Gene L., and Douglas Jackson-Smith. &#x201C;Public Perception of the Oil and Gas Industry: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.&#x201D; Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2010. https://doi.org/10.2118/134253-MS.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"NK8C4RKK","version":1302,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Public Perception of the Oil and Gas Industry: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gene L.","lastName":"Theodori"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Jackson-Smith"}],"abstractNote":"Abstract Data collected in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals in Tarrant County, Texas, were used to empirically explore issues associated with public perception of the natural gas industry.

During application, severe damage and mortality of ground vegetation was observed, followed about 10 d later by premature leaf drop by the overstory trees. Two years after fluid application, 56% of the trees within the fluid application area were dead. Ehrh. was the tree species with the highest mortality, and L. was the least affected, although all tree species present on the site showed damage symptoms and mortality. Surface soils (0-10 cm) were sampled in July and October 2008, June and October 2009, and May 2010 on the fluid application area and an adjacent reference area to evaluate the effects of the hydrofracturing fluid on soil chemistry and to attempt to identify the main chemical constituents of the hydrofracturing fluid. Surface soil concentrations of sodium and chloride increased 50-fold as a result of the land application of hydrofracturing fluids and declined over time. Soil acidity in the fluid application area declined with time, perhaps from altered organic matter cycling. This case study identifies the need for further research to help understand the nature and the environmental impacts of hydrofracturing fluids to devise optimal, safe disposal strategies.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Environmental Quality","volume":"40","issue":"4","pages":"1340-1344","date":"2011 Jul-Aug","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"J.

The absence of comprehensive federal legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing has placed the regulation of unconventional gas drilling primarily within the purview of state and local governments. This report examines public opinion in Michigan and Pennsylvania on a series of issues concerning the impact of fracking on the economy, environmental protection, and information disclosure. Pennsylvania and Michigan have been selected as the focus of this report because they represent states with varied levels of hydraulic fracturing within their borders. Pennsylvania has emerged as one of the nation’s leaders in terms of the number of hydraulic fracturing sites with extensive drilling occurring in the commonwealth, and also has high levels of public debate and policy development related to this issue. Conversely, fracking has just begun to develop on a large scale within Michigan with corresponding public engagement around the matter in its early stages. These differences present a valuable opportunity to examine where the public in these two states stands on an array of issues related to fracking.","reportNumber":"ID 2313276","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2013/05/01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"The National Surveys on Energy and Environment Public Opinion on Fracking","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2313276","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"CLOSUP","type":1},{"tag":"Michigan","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"climate change","type":1},{"tag":"energy","type":1},{"tag":"environment","type":1},{"tag":"fracking","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"national surveys on energy and environment","type":1},{"tag":"survey","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:26:02Z"}},{"key":"7FG3YC8C","version":1246,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7FG3YC8C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7FG3YC8C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Sampling was conducted before, during, and after drilling and hydraulic fracturing of a new natural gas well pad. Weekly air sampling for 1 year revealed that the number of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and their concentrations were highest during the initial drilling phase and did not increase during hydraulic fracturing in this closed-loop system. Methylene chloride, a toxic solvent not reported in products used in drilling or hydraulic fracturing, was detected 73% of the time; several times in high concentrations. A literature search of the health effects of the NMHCs revealed that many had multiple health effects, including 30 that affect the endocrine system, which is susceptible to chemical impacts at very low concentrations, far less than government safety standards. Selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were at concentrations greater than those at which prenatally exposed children in urban studies had lower developmental and IQ scores. The human and environmental health impacts of the NMHCs, which are ozone precursors, should be examined further given that the natural gas industry is now operating in close proximity to human residences and public lands.","publicationTitle":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal","volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":"86-105","date":"January 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/10807039.2012.749447","ISSN":"1080-7039","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2012.749447","accessDate":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"PAHs","type":1},{"tag":"VOCs","type":1},{"tag":"drilling","type":1},{"tag":"endocrine disruptors","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"non-methane hydrocarbons","type":1}],"collections":["FUGV49UB","UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z","dateModified":"2018-05-07T15:20:22Z"}},{"key":"BWPT4CA5","version":1203,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BWPT4CA5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BWPT4CA5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Urbina","parsedDate":"2011-02-26","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Urbina, Ian. &#x201C;Regulation Lax as Gas Wells&#x2019; Tainted Water Hits Rivers.&#x201D; <i>The New York Times</i>, February 26, 2011, sec.

Its opponents dispute these claims and point to significant environmental and public health risks associated with hydrofracking-risks that must be considered in adopting government regulations needed to protect the public interest. One of the many issues raised by hydrofracking is which level of government should regulate which aspects of the practice. This debate is complicated by the fact that the risks associated with hydrofracking raise concerns of federal, state, and local importance and fit within existing regulatory regimes of each of these levels of government. This Article begins by describing the limited aspects of hydrofracking that are currently regulated by the federal government, which leaves many of the risks unaddressed, opening the door for state and local regulation. This Article describes the legal tension between state and local governments in regulating hydrofracking in the four states that contain the immense Marcellus shale formation. Its particular focus is on court decisions that determine whether local land use regulation, which typically regulates local industrial activity, has been preempted by state statutes that historically regulate gas drilling operations. This investigation suggests that the broad scope and durability of local land use power as a key feature of municipal governance tends to make courts reluctant to usurp local prerogatives in the absence of extraordinarily clear' and express language of preemption in state statutes that regulate gas drilling. The Article concludes with an examination of how the legitimate interests and legal authority of all three levels of government can be integrated in a system of cooperative governance.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"47","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T17:23:12Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T17:23:12Z"}},{"key":"AXHB63N5","version":1144,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AXHB63N5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AXHB63N5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}}},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Gas produces approximately half the amount of CO2 per unit of primary energy compared with coal. Here we consider a scenario where a fraction of coal usage is replaced by natural gas (i.e., methane, CH4) over a given time period, and where a percentage of the gas production is assumed to leak into the atmosphere. The additional CH4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO2 emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"108","issue":"3","pages":"601","date":"2011/10/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0217-3","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"Coal to gas","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0217-3","accessDate":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T15:22:31Z"}},{"key":"FIS2BS9Z","version":1072,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FIS2BS9Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FIS2BS9Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Myers","parsedDate":"2012-12","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Myers, Tom. &#x201C;Potential Contaminant Pathways from Hydraulically Fractured Shale to Aquifers.&#x201D; <i>Ground Water</i> 50, no. 6 (December 2012): 872&#x2013;82. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00933.x.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FIS2BS9Z","version":1072,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Potential contaminant pathways from hydraulically fractured shale to aquifers","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Myers"}],"abstractNote":"Hydraulic fracturing of deep shale beds to develop natural gas has caused concern regarding the potential for various forms of water pollution. Two potential pathways-advective transport through bulk media and preferential flow through fractures-could allow the transport of contaminants from the fractured shale to aquifers. There is substantial geologic evidence that natural vertical flow drives contaminants, mostly brine, to near the surface from deep evaporite sources. Interpretative modeling shows that advective transport could require up to tens of thousands of years to move contaminants to the surface, but also that fracking the shale could reduce that transport time to tens or hundreds of years. Conductive faults or fracture zones, as found throughout the Marcellus shale region, could reduce the travel time further. Injection of up to 15,000,000 L of fluid into the shale generates high pressure at the well, which decreases with distance from the well and with time after injection as the fluid advects through the shale. The advection displaces native fluids, mostly brine, and fractures the bulk media widening existing fractures. Simulated pressure returns to pre-injection levels in about 300 d. The overall system requires from 3 to 6 years to reach a new equilibrium reflecting the significant changes caused by fracking the shale, which could allow advective transport to aquifers in less than 10 years. The rapid expansion of hydraulic fracturing requires that monitoring systems be employed to track the movement of contaminants and that gas wells have a reasonable offset from faults.","publicationTitle":"Ground Water","volume":"50","issue":"6","pages":"872-882","date":"2012 Nov-Dec","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ground Water","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00933.x","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 22509908","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental Monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Fossil Fuels","type":1},{"tag":"Geologic Sediments","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Industrial Waste","type":1},{"tag":"Models, Statistical","type":1},{"tag":"New York","type":1},{"tag":"Risk Factors","type":1},{"tag":"Salts","type":1},{"tag":"Time Factors","type":1},{"tag":"Water Movements","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollutants, Chemical","type":1}],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-04T15:21:38Z","dateModified":"2018-05-04T15:21:38Z"}},{"key":"BR4569KI","version":1069,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BR4569KI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BR4569KI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"KUUSKRAA and MARSHALL","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

The US Energy Information Administration projects that unconventional gas will supply nearly half of US gas production by 2035. In addition, by significantly expanding and diversifying the gas supply internationally, the exploitation of new unconventional gas resources has the potential to reshape energy policy at national and international levels—altering geopolitics and energy security, recasting the economics of energy technology investment decisions, and shifting trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In anticipation of this expansion, one of the perceived core advantages of unconventional gas—its relatively moderate GHG impact compared to coal—has recently come under scrutiny. In this paper, we compare the GHG footprints of conventional natural gas, unconventional natural gas (i.e. shale gas that has been produced using the process of hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking'), and coal in a transparent and consistent way, focusing primarily on the electricity generation sector. We show that for electricity generation the GHG impacts of shale gas are 11% higher than those of conventional gas, and only 56% that of coal for standard assumptions.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"6","issue":"4","pages":"044008","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The accelerated production of natural gas has triggered a debate concerning the safety and possible environmental impacts of these operations. This study investigates one of the critical aspects of the environmental effects; the possible degradation of water quality in shallow aquifers overlying producing shale formations. The geochemistry of domestic groundwater wells was investigated in aquifers overlying the Fayetteville Shale in north-central Arkansas, where approximately 4000 wells have been drilled since 2004 to extract unconventional natural gas. Monitoring was performed on 127 drinking water wells and the geochemistry of major ions, trace metals, CH4 gas content and its C isotopes (δ13CCH4), and select isotope tracers (δ11B, 87Sr/86Sr, δ2H, δ18O, δ13CDIC) compared to the composition of flowback-water samples directly from Fayetteville Shale gas wells. Dissolved CH4 was detected in 63% of the drinking-water wells (32 of 51 samples), but only six wells exceeded concentrations of 0.5mg CH4/L. The δ13CCH4 of dissolved CH4 ranged from −42.3‰ to −74.7‰, with the most negative values characteristic of a biogenic source also associated with the highest observed CH4 concentrations, with a possible minor contribution of trace amounts of thermogenic CH4. The majority of these values are distinct from the reported thermogenic composition of the Fayetteville Shale gas (δ13CCH4=−35.4‰ to −41.9‰). Based on major element chemistry, four shallow groundwater types were identified: (1) low (<100mg/L) total dissolved solids (TDS), (2) TDS>100mg/L and Ca–HCO3 dominated, (3) TDS>100mg/L and Na–HCO3 dominated, and (4) slightly saline groundwater with TDS>100mg/L and Cl>20mg/L with elevated Br/Cl ratios (>0.001). The Sr (87Sr/86Sr=0.7097–0.7166), C (δ13CDIC=−21.3‰ to −4.7‰), and B (δ11B=3.9–32.9‰) isotopes clearly reflect water–rock interactions within the aquifer rocks, while the stable O and H isotopic composition mimics the local meteoric water composition. Overall, there was a geochemical gradient from low-mineralized recharge water to more evolved Ca–HCO3, and higher-mineralized Na–HCO3 composition generated by a combination of carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering, and reverse base-exchange reactions. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the bulk shallow groundwater samples were distinct from the Na–Cl type Fayetteville flowback/produced waters (TDS ∼10,000–20,000mg/L). Yet, the high Br/Cl variations in a small subset of saline shallow groundwater suggest that they were derived from dilution of saline water similar to the brine in the Fayetteville Shale. Nonetheless, no spatial relationship was found between CH4 and salinity occurrences in shallow drinking water wells with proximity to shale-gas drilling sites. The integration of multiple geochemical and isotopic proxies shows no direct evidence of contamination in shallow drinking-water aquifers associated with natural gas extraction from the Fayetteville Shale.","publicationTitle":"Applied Geochemistry","volume":"35","issue":"","pages":"207-220","date":"August 1, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Geochemistry","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.04.013","ISSN":"0883-2927","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292713001133","accessDate":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z","dateModified":"2018-05-02T19:37:45Z"}},{"key":"6K724RZK","version":947,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6K724RZK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6K724RZK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Jackson et al.","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Jackson, Robert B, Brooks Rainey Pearson, Stephen G Osborn, Nathaniel R Warner, and Avner Vengosh. &#x201C;Research and Policy Recommendations for Hydraulic Fracturing and Shale&#x2010;Gas Extraction,&#x201D; n.d., 12.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6K724RZK","version":947,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Research and Policy Recommendations for Hydraulic Fracturing and Shale‐Gas Extraction","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert B","lastName":"Jackson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brooks Rainey","lastName":"Pearson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen G","lastName":"Osborn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nathaniel R","lastName":"Warner"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Avner","lastName":"Vengosh"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"12","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-02T19:37:10Z","dateModified":"2018-05-02T19:37:10Z"}},{"key":"BZPB5Q6U","version":944,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/BZPB5Q6U","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/BZPB5Q6U","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sarah K.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), residents of Pavillion petitioned EPA, asking the agency to investigate whether groundwater contamination exists, its extent, and possible sources. Following the petition, EPA began its investigation three years ago. Although the final report may contain revised or more specific conclusions, the draft report indicated that EPA had identified certain constituents in groundwater above the production zone of the Pavillion natural gas wells that are consistent with some of the constituents used in natural gas well operations, including the process of hydraulic fracturing. In its report, EPA claimed that its approach to the investigation best supports the explanation that inorganic and organic compounds associated with hydraulic fracturing have contaminated the aquifer at or below the depths used for domestic water supply in the Pavillion area. EPA also stated that its approach indicates that gas production activities have likely enhanced the migration of natural gas in the aquifer and the migration of gas to domestic wells in the area. EPA did not appear to conclude that there was a definitive link to a release from the production wells, nor to the constituents found in domestic wells in shallower parts of the aquifer.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"24","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T20:17:24Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T20:17:24Z"}},{"key":"AEGXV85Z","version":932,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/AEGXV85Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/AEGXV85Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Murrill","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Murrill, Brandon J. &#x201C;Hydraulic Fracturing and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): Selected Issues,&#x201D; n.d., 10.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"AEGXV85Z","version":932,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Hydraulic Fracturing and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): Selected Issues","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brandon J","lastName":"Murrill"}],"abstractNote":"Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to recover oil and natural gas from underground low permeability rock formations.

A meta-analysis of characteristics of five PW sources [i.e. shale gas (SGPWs), conventional natural gas (NGPWs), conventional oil (OPWs), coal-bed methane (CBMPWs), tight gas sands (TGSPWs)] was conducted from peer-reviewed literature, government or industry documents, book chapters, internet sources, analytical records from industry, and analyses of PW samples. This meta-analysis assembled a large dataset to extract information of interest such as differences and similarities in constituent and constituent concentrations across these sources of PWs. The PW data analyzed were comprised of 377 coal-bed methane, 165 oilfield, 137 tight gas sand, 4000 natural gas, and 541 shale gas records. Majority of SGPWs, NGPWs, OPWs, and TGSPWs contain chloride concentrations ranging from saline (>30000mgL−1) to hypersaline (>40000mgL−1), while most CBMPWs were fresh (<5000mgL−1). For inorganic constituents, most SGPW and NGPW iron concentrations exceeded the numeric criterion for irrigation and surface water discharge, while OPW and CBMPW iron concentrations were less than the criterion. Approximately one-fourth of the PW samples in this database are fresh and likely need minimal treatment for metal and metalloid constituents prior to use, while some PWs are brackish (5000–30000mgCl−L−1) to saline containing metals and metalloids that may require considerable treatment.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the “Not in My Backyard” (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity—respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent's location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age. We discuss the implications of these findings for effective risk communication as well as the importance of incorporating spatial analysis into public opinion research on perceptions of energy development.","publicationTitle":"Risk Analysis","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/risa.12989","ISSN":"1539-6924","shortTitle":"","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/risa.12989","accessDate":"2018-05-01T13:01:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"© 2018 Society for Risk Analysis","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Fracking","type":1},{"tag":"geographic proximity","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"unconventional oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T13:01:01Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T13:01:14Z"}},{"key":"3J8HZ52W","version":841,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3J8HZ52W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3J8HZ52W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Kassotis et al.","parsedDate":"2018-04-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Kassotis, Christopher D., Danh C.

Hydraulic fracturing, a common form of stimulation, involves the high-pressure injection of water, chemicals, and sand to fracture the target layer and release trapped natural gas and/or oil. Spills and/or discharges of wastewater have been shown to impact surface, ground, and drinking water. The goals of this study were to characterize the endocrine activities and measure select organic contaminants in groundwater from conventional oil and gas (COG) and UOG production regions of Wyoming. Groundwater samples were collected from each region, solid-phase extracted, and assessed for endocrine activities (estrogen, androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and thyroid receptor agonism and antagonism), using reporter gene assays in human endometrial cells. Water samples from UOG and conventional oil areas exhibited greater ER antagonist activities than water samples from conventional gas areas. Samples from UOG areas tended to exhibit progesterone receptor antagonism more often, suggesting there may be a UOG-related impact on these endocrine activities. We also report UOG-specific contaminants in Pavillion groundwater extracts, and these same chemicals at high concentrations in a local UOG wastewater sample. A unique suite of contaminants was observed in groundwater from a permitted drinking water well at a COG well pad and not at any UOG sites; high levels of endocrine activities (most notably, maximal estrogenic activity) were noted there, suggesting putative impacts on endocrine bioactivities by COG. As such, we report two levels of evidence for groundwater contamination by both UOG and COG operations in Wyoming.","publicationTitle":"Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"1-12","date":"2018/04/05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Arch Environ Contam Toxicol","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s00244-018-0521-2","ISSN":"0090-4341, 1432-0703","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-018-0521-2","accessDate":"2018-05-01T12:58:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-01T12:58:20Z","dateModified":"2018-05-01T12:58:33Z"}},{"key":"KU59FVYI","version":833,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KU59FVYI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KU59FVYI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Sawyer et al.","parsedDate":"2006-04-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Sawyer, Hall, Ryan M.

Our analysis is based on extensive field research, including a site visit and interviews with industry participants. It is further cross-validated by examining similar costs for development of Marcellus Wells by a vertically-integrated exploration and production firm.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2181675","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2181675","accessDate":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-26T14:07:10Z"}},{"key":"IYJY4YAS","version":773,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IYJY4YAS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IYJY4YAS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Entrekin Sally et al.","parsedDate":"2011-10-06","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Entrekin Sally, Evans-White Michelle, Johnson Brent, and Hagenbuch Elisabeth. &#x201C;Rapid Expansion of Natural Gas Development Poses a Threat to Surface Waters.&#x201D; <i>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</i> 9, no. 9 (October 6, 2011): 503&#x2013;11. https://doi.org/10.1890/110053.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IYJY4YAS","version":773,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Rapid expansion of natural gas development poses a threat to surface waters","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Entrekin Sally"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Evans-White Michelle"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Johnson Brent"},{"creatorType":"author","name":"Hagenbuch Elisabeth"}],"abstractNote":"Extraction of natural gas from hard?to?reach reservoirs has expanded around the world and poses multiple environmental threats to surface waters. Improved drilling and extraction technology used to access low permeability natural gas requires millions of liters of water and a suite of chemicals that may be toxic to aquatic biota. There is growing concern among the scientific community and the general public that rapid and extensive natural gas development in the US could lead to degradation of natural resources. Gas wells are often close to surface waters that could be impacted by elevated sediment runoff from pipelines and roads, alteration of streamflow as a result of water extraction, and contamination from introduced chemicals or the resulting wastewater. However, the data required to fully understand these potential threats are currently lacking. Scientists therefore need to study the changes in ecosystem structure and function caused by natural gas extraction and to use such data to inform sound environmental policy.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","volume":"9","issue":"9","pages":"503-511","date":"October 6, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","language":"","DOI":"10.1890/110053","ISSN":"1540-9295","shortTitle":"","url":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/110053","accessDate":"2018-04-20T17:37:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-20T17:37:04Z","dateModified":"2018-04-20T17:37:04Z"}},{"key":"PJXRJVZZ","version":768,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/PJXRJVZZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/PJXRJVZZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"DEC","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Despite access to potable well water, the poisoned ewes willingly consumed toxic doses of condensate that contaminated surface water. Eight animals died without premonitory signs; the remainder became ill over the course of a few days to 3 weeks. The principal cause of mortality was aspiration pneumonia, but myocardial degeneration and necrosis, renal tubular damage, gastritis, enteritis, and meningeal edema and hyperemia were also observed. Gas chromatographic analysis identified chemical traces of the hydrocarbons in the tissues, and \"fingerprinting,\" the process of matching chromatographic tracings, provided forensic proof of the contamination source. Atomic absorption spectroscopy and cholinesterase analyses were performed to eliminate the possibility of toxicosis by heavy metal contaminants or other constituents. This appears to be the first reported incidence of natural gas condensate toxicity involving sheep or other ruminants. Although the available literature presents a suggestive pattern of clinical signs and pathologic lesions of petroleum product poisoning, diagnostic investigations should employ detailed analytic examination because each source of petroleum hydrocarbons contains unique sets of components that may produce different toxic effects.","publicationTitle":"Veterinary Pathology","volume":"29","issue":"1","pages":"11-20","date":"Jan 1992","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Vet.

Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock methane emissions in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock methane emissions factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. <h3>Results</h3> Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;18.2&nbsp;Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11% greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8.4% increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36.7% increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management methane emissions for 2011 in the US increased by 71.8%. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock methane emissions, (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0.05&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.05 degree resolution. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our revised bottom-up estimates of global livestock methane emissions are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual methane emissions since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock methane emissions, while not the dominant overall source of global methane emissions, may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000s to 2010s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock methane emissions from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and bottom-up estimates of methane emissions, will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments.","publicationTitle":"Carbon Balance and Management","volume":"12","issue":"16","pages":"","date":"2017/09/29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:21:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"2017 The Author(s)","extra":"DOI: 10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:58:54Z"}},{"key":"FB92XS3M","version":1571,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FB92XS3M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FB92XS3M","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4865727,"username":"cmhoenow","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/cmhoenow","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Colborn et al.","parsedDate":"2011-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Colborn, Theo, Carol Kwiatkowski, Kim Schultz, and Mary Bachran. &#x201C;Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective.&#x201D; <i>Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal</i> 17, no. 5 (September 1, 2011): 1039&#x2013;56. https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"FB92XS3M","version":1571,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Colborn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carol","lastName":"Kwiatkowski"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Schultz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Bachran"}],"abstractNote":"The technology to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and amounts of toxic chemicals. A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas operations was compiled. Literature searches were conducted to determine potential health effects of the 353 chemicals identified by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers. More than 75% of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Approximately 40–50% could affect the brain/nervous system, immune and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys; 37% could affect the endocrine system; and 25% could cause cancer and mutations. These results indicate that many chemicals used during the fracturing and drilling stages of gas operations may have long-term health effects that are not immediately expressed. In addition, an example was provided of waste evaporation pit residuals that contained numerous chemicals on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) lists of hazardous substances. The discussion highlights the difficulty of developing effective water quality monitoring programs. To protect public health we recommend full disclosure of the contents of all products, extensive air and water monitoring, coordinated environmental/human health studies, and regulation of fracturing under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act.","publicationTitle":"Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal","volume":"17","issue":"5","pages":"1039-1056","date":"September 1, 2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","ISSN":"1080-7039","shortTitle":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2011.605662","accessDate":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"drilling","type":1},{"tag":"health","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"ozone","type":1},{"tag":"pollution","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC","UGH6PIYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:33:35Z"}},{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":606,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/F5PD26ZZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Michaels","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Michaels, Guy. &#x201C;The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation.&#x201D; <i>The Economic Journal</i> 121 (2011): 31&#x2013;57. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"F5PD26ZZ","version":606,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Long Term Consequences of Resource-Based Specialisation","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Michaels"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"The Economic Journal","volume":"121","issue":"","pages":"31-57","date":"2011","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x","ISSN":"1468-0297","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-12T18:24:21Z"}},{"key":"NLKFG6C8","version":557,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NLKFG6C8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NLKFG6C8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ellis et al.","parsedDate":"2016-10-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ellis, Colter, Gene L.

In New York and Pennsylvania, the public debate about the prospect or continuation of high volume hydraulic fracturing for shale gas has revolved around its environmental impacts, particularly its effects on water quality, while taking as a given that exploitation of this new natural gas asset will produce significant economic benefits for the states’ economies. If we want to understand how this new kind of natural gas drilling will affect communities in Pennsylvania and New York, the economic impact models that have been used to project potential benefits and job creation give us only a fraction of the information we need. To fully assess the economic effects, policy makers and citizens need to understand what will drive the pace and scale of drilling and the associated boom-bust cycle. This cycle will have implications for jobs, revenues, the cumulative impact of shale gas development, and the longer-term economic development prospects for drilling regions within the Marcellus Shale area.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"34","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:30:35Z"}},{"key":"NQRMSEMN","version":493,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NQRMSEMN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NQRMSEMN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Huntington","parsedDate":"2017-09-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Huntington, Hillard G. &#x201C;Changing the Game?: Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies,&#x201D; September 1, 2017. https://doi.org/10.2172/1411245.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"NQRMSEMN","version":493,"itemType":"report","title":"Changing the Game?: Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hillard G.","lastName":"Huntington"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"EMFReport--26, 1411245","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"","date":"2017-09-01","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Changing the Game?","url":"http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1411245/","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.2172/1411245","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:29:58Z"}},{"key":"6KPW6I5P","version":491,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6KPW6I5P","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6KPW6I5P","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Cosgrove","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cosgrove, Brandan. &#x201C;The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development: A Natural Experiment along the New York and Pennsylvania Border,&#x201D; n.d., 32.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6KPW6I5P","version":491,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Economic Impact of Shale Gas Development: A Natural Experiment along the New York and Pennsylvania Border","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brandan","lastName":"Cosgrove"}],"abstractNote":"In the United States, the rapid increase in shale gas production has recently stimulated local economies.

In response to these calls, we have compiled a spatially-resolved inventory of changes in water consumption associated with the coal-to-gas transition in Pennsylvania at the resolution of watersheds from 2009 to 2012. Results indicate that the total water consumption of the fuel extraction and power sectors in Pennsylvania increased by 7.6 million m3 (2 Bgal) over four years. At the state and watershed scales, we compare total water consumption for the coal-to-gas transition to a case where only the water consumed across two life cycle stages of electricity generation is considered – fuel extraction and use at the power plant to generate electricity. The results for the latter indicate that water consumption decreased by over 15.1 million m3 (4 Bgal). For both cases, watershed-level results showed water consumption generally increased in watersheds with growing shale gas activity or new natural gas capacity, while it decreased with diminishing coal-fired generation. Watershed-scale water consumption from 2009 to 2012 may be reversed from a net increase to decrease (and vice versa) when the total water consumption is compared to the water consumed specifically for life cycle stages of electricity generation, reinforcing the importance of further developing spatially-resolved inventories for LCA. Focusing on the water consumption associated with only electricity generation and its fuel use does not capture the full effects of fuel extracted for use in other sectors. We suggest that spatially-explicit inventories that include multiple life cycle stages should be a critical component in the development of more comprehensive, spatial LCA methodology. Spatial differentiation in inventories is necessary to adequately characterize watershed-level impacts that can be normalized over a functional unit. The approach can be used as a complementary assessment to LCA that can inform policy-makers and investors about where energy developments may pose additional risks to water supply and availability.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cleaner Production","volume":"184","issue":"","pages":"366-374","date":"May 20, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Cleaner Production","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.217","ISSN":"0959-6526","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261830547X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Coal mining","type":1},{"tag":"Life cycle assessment","type":1},{"tag":"Power generation","type":1},{"tag":"Shale gas","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Water use","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:27:39Z"}},{"key":"X5ZVU5UN","version":484,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5ZVU5UN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5ZVU5UN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Weber","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Weber, Jeremy G. &#x201C;A Decade of Natural Gas Development: The Makings of a Resource Curse?&#x201D; <i>Resource and Energy Economics</i> 37 (2014): 168&#x2013;83. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2013.11.013.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"X5ZVU5UN","version":484,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A decade of natural gas development: The makings of a resource curse?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy G.","lastName":"Weber"}],"abstractNote":"Many studies ﬁnd that areas more dependent on natural resources grow more slowly – a relationship known as the resource curse.

We study how shale gas development affected zip code level housing values in Texas’ Barnett Shale, which splits the Dallas-Fort Worth region in half and is the most extensively developed shale formation in the U.S. We find that housing in shale zip codes appreciated more than nonshale zip codes during peak development and less afterwards, with a net positive effect of five to six percentage points from 1997 to 2013. The greater appreciation in part reflects improved local public finances: the value of natural gas rights expanded the local tax base by $82,000 per student, increasing school revenues and expenditures. Within shale zip codes, however, an extra well per square kilometer was associated with a 1.6 percentage point decrease in appreciation over the study period.","reportNumber":"ID 2467622","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2014/07/17","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"Shale Gas Development and Housing Values over a Decade","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2467622","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Barnett Shale","type":1},{"tag":"natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"property values","type":1}],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:25:03Z"}},{"key":"76VR3HRJ","version":483,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/76VR3HRJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/76VR3HRJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"America's Natural Gas Alliance","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">America&#x2019;s Natural Gas Alliance. &#x201C;The Economic and Employment Contributions of Unconventional Gas Development in State Economies.&#x201D; Accessed April 10, 2018. http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/State_Unconv_Gas_Economic_Contribution_Main.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"76VR3HRJ","version":483,"itemType":"webpage","title":"The Economic and Employment Contributions of Unconventional Gas Development in State Economies","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"America's Natural Gas Alliance"}],"abstractNote":"","websiteTitle":"","websiteType":"","date":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://marcelluscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/State_Unconv_Gas_Economic_Contribution_Main.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:23:59Z","language":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:24:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:24:40Z"}},{"key":"YUXSHNZM","version":479,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YUXSHNZM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Maniloff and Mastromonaco","parsedDate":"2014-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Maniloff, Peter, and Ralph Mastromonaco. &#x201C;The Local Economic Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing and Determinants of Dutch Disease.&#x201D; Working Papers.

First, using government local economic data matched to highly detailed national oil and natural gas panel data, we estimate the effect that new \"fracking\" installations have on local job growth and average earnings, controlling for time-varying unobserved determinants of job growth, overall, by industry, and by region. We find that overall employment effects are substantial although smaller than some previous studies. Second, we show that shale development increases wages in manufacturing in counties with relatively tight labor markets and little prior oil and gas industry presence. Increased wages in the manufacturing sector suggests the possibility of a loss of competitiveness in some counties with shale oil and gas resources, raising the specter of a future resource curse.","reportNumber":"2014-08","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"Working Papers","place":"","institution":"Colorado School of Mines, Division of Economics and Business","date":"2014/10","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/mns/wpaper/wp201408.html","accessDate":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ideas.repec.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"dutch disease","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"job growth","type":1},{"tag":"local employment","type":1},{"tag":"resource curse","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T22:14:15Z"}},{"key":"6XQYX9BZ","version":599,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6XQYX9BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marchand and Weber","parsedDate":"2015-09-30","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Marchand, Joseph, and Jeremy Weber. &#x201C;The Labor Market and School Finance Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Teacher Quality and Student Achievement.&#x201D; Working Papers.

One of the issues of concern is the migration of oil, gas, or produced water to a groundwater aquifer resulting in contamination of drinking water. Since methane is the major component of natural gas and it can be dissolved and transported with groundwater, stray gas in aquifers has elicited attention. The initial step toward understanding the environmental impacts of oil and gas activities, such as well drilling and fracturing, is to determine the occurrence, where it is and where it came from. In this study, groundwater methane data that has been collected in response to a relatively new regulation in Colorado is analyzed. Dissolved methane was detected in 78% of groundwater wells with an average concentration of 4.0 mg/L and a range of 0–37.1 mg/L. Greater than 95% of the methane found in groundwater wells was classified as having a microbial origin, and there was minimal overlap between the C and H isotopic characterization of the produced gas and dissolved methane measured in the aquifer. Neither density of oil/gas wells nor distance to oil/gas wells had a significant impact on methane concentration suggesting other important factors were influencing methane generation and distribution. Thermogenic methane was detected in two aquifer wells indicating a potential contamination pathway from the producing formation, but microbial-origin gas was by far the predominant source of dissolved methane in the Wattenberg field.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"3","pages":"1484-1491","date":"February 4, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This shift in the energy industry has been accompanied by rising concerns over potential impacts on water resources because producing these fuels is thought to require more water per unit of energy produced than conventional sources and may lead to greater degradation of water quality. In this paper, we address these emerging environmental issues by (a) providing a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the water quantity and quality implications of producing the main unconventional fossil fuels in North America and (b) characterizing the diﬀerences in social costs that arise from the extraction and production of these fuels versus those from conventional fossil fuel production.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2352481","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Water Resources and Unconventional Fossil Fuel Development","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2352481","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED","QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:54:11Z"}},{"key":"RPWA3G2C","version":447,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/RPWA3G2C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/RPWA3G2C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schnell et al.","parsedDate":"2009-02","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schnell, Russell C., Samuel J.

Photochemical ozone production near the Earth’s surface is considered a summertime, urban phenomenon1,2,3, where hourly average ozone concentrations can exceed 150 p.p.b., compared with background values of about 50 p.p.b., and wintertime ozone concentrations in the US are usually in the range of 35–50 p.p.b. (refs 1, 2, 3). Here we report rapid, diurnal photochemical production of ozone during air temperatures as low as −17 ∘C, in the rural Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, in the vicinity of the Jonah–Pinedale Anticline natural gas field. We find that hourly average ozone concentrations rise from 10–30 p.p.b. at night to more than 140 p.p.b. shortly after solar noon, under the influence of a stagnant, high-pressure system that promotes cold temperatures, low wind speeds and limited cloudiness. Under these conditions, an intense, shallow temperature inversion develops in the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere, which traps high concentrations of ozone precursors at night. During daytime, photolytic ozone production then leads to the observed high concentrations. We suggest that similar ozone production during wintertime is probably occurring around the world under comparable industrial and meteorological conditions.","publicationTitle":"Nature Geoscience","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"120-122","date":"2009-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/ngeo415","ISSN":"1752-0908","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo415","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2009 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:51:49Z"}},{"key":"KPWG3XZ9","version":439,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/KPWG3XZ9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/KPWG3XZ9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"McJeon et al.","parsedDate":"2014-10","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">McJeon, Haewon, Jae Edmonds, Nico Bauer, Leon Clarke, Brian Fisher, Brian P.

If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources2. The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions3,4,5,6. Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal7,8. Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energy–economy–climate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope9,10 or its coverage of greenhouse gases2. Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models11 of energy–economy–climate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from −2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from −0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy9,10.","publicationTitle":"Nature","volume":"514","issue":"7523","pages":"482-485","date":"2014-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1038/nature13837","ISSN":"1476-4687","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13837","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2014 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:48:46Z"}},{"key":"Q87HTPTM","version":569,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Q87HTPTM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Q87HTPTM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gopalakrishnan, Sathya, and H.

While there is much enthusiasm surrounding the benefits from this source of energy as a potential path to energy independence, very little is known about the environmental risks associated with this exploration activity. In this paper, we present one of the first empirical studies to measure the impact of early shale exploration as capitalized into surrounding property values. Our dataset combines real estate data, shale well data and land use data in Washington County, Pennsylvania from 2008 to mid-2010 to estimate the impact of shale activity on nearby housing values using a Box-Cox hedonic specification. We find that households are adversely impacted by shale gas exploration activity, but this impact depends on the proximity and intensity of shale activity and is largely transitory in duration. While the magnitude of the overall effect of an additional shale well within one mile from the property is modest (-0.8%) this impact is heterogeneous. The effect is larger for households located close to major highways and sourced with private well water. The impacts are larger and more persistent for properties surrounded by agricultural lands.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2117932","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Is the Shale Boom a Bust for Nearby Residents?","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2117932","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:47:06Z"}},{"key":"6RV99VDW","version":424,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6RV99VDW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6RV99VDW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Howarth et al.","parsedDate":"2012","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Howarth, Robert W., Renee Santoro, and Anthony Ingraffea. &#x201C;Venting and Leaking of Methane from Shale Gas Development: Response to Cathles et Al.&#x201D; <i>Climatic Change</i> 113, no. 2 (2012): 537&#x2013;49. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6RV99VDW","version":424,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Venting and leaking of methane from shale gas development: response to Cathles et al.","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Howarth"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Renee","lastName":"Santoro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ingraffea"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"113","issue":"2","pages":"537-549","date":"7/2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"Venting and leaking of methane from shale gas development","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-012-0401-0","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:31Z"}},{"key":"WJUHN3B9","version":424,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/WJUHN3B9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/WJUHN3B9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Howarth et al.","parsedDate":"2011-06-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Howarth, Robert W., Renee Santoro, and Anthony Ingraffea. &#x201C;Methane and the Greenhouse-Gas Footprint of Natural Gas from Shale Formations.&#x201D; <i>Climatic Change</i> 106, no. 4 (June 1, 2011): 679. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"WJUHN3B9","version":424,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Methane and the greenhouse-gas footprint of natural gas from shale formations","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Howarth"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Renee","lastName":"Santoro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ingraffea"}],"abstractNote":"We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured—as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids—and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.","publicationTitle":"Climatic Change","volume":"106","issue":"4","pages":"679","date":"2011/06/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Climatic Change","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:43:13Z"}},{"key":"SDV7D8IS","version":421,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/SDV7D8IS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/SDV7D8IS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Laurenzi and Jersey","parsedDate":"2013-05-07","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Laurenzi, Ian J., and Gilbert R.

The analysis employs the most extensive data set of any LCA of shale gas to date, encompassing data from actual gas production and power generation operations. Results indicate that a typical Marcellus gas life cycle yields 466 kg CO2eq/MWh (80% confidence interval: 450–567 kg CO2eq/MWh) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 224 gal/MWh (80% CI: 185–305 gal/MWh) of freshwater consumption. Operations associated with hydraulic fracturing constitute only 1.2% of the life cycle GHG emissions, and 6.2% of the life cycle freshwater consumption. These results are influenced most strongly by the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of the well and the power plant efficiency: increase in either quantity will reduce both life cycle freshwater consumption and GHG emissions relative to power generated at the plant. We conclude by comparing the life cycle impacts of Marcellus gas and U.S. coal: The carbon footprint of Marcellus gas is 53% (80% CI: 44–61%) lower than coal, and its freshwater consumption is about 50% of coal. We conclude that substantial GHG reductions and freshwater savings may result from the replacement of coal-fired power generation with gas-fired power generation.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"47","issue":"9","pages":"4896-4903","date":"May 7, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

To further characterize the emissions of methane and non?methane hydrocarbons (propane, n?butane, i?pentane, n?pentane and benzene) around BAO, a pilot study involving automobile?based surveys was carried out during the summer of 2008. A mix of venting emissions (leaks) of raw natural gas and flashing emissions from condensate storage tanks can explain the alkane ratios we observe in air masses impacted by oil and gas operations in northeastern Colorado. Using the WRAP Phase III inventory of total volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and gas exploration, production and processing, together with flashing and venting emission speciation profiles provided by State agencies or the oil and gas industry, we derive a range of bottom?up speciated emissions for Weld County in 2008. We use the observed ambient molar ratios and flashing and venting emissions data to calculate top?down scenarios for the amount of natural gas leaked to the atmosphere and the associated methane and non?methane emissions. Our analysis suggests that the emissions of the species we measured are most likely underestimated in current inventories and that the uncertainties attached to these estimates can be as high as a factor of two.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","volume":"117","issue":"D4","pages":"","date":"February 21, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","language":"","DOI":"10.1029/2011JD016360","ISSN":"0148-0227","shortTitle":"Hydrocarbon emissions characterization in the Colorado Front Range","url":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011JD016360","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"NOAA","type":1},{"tag":"alkanes","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric measurements","type":1},{"tag":"benzene","type":1},{"tag":"methane","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK","FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:18:10Z"}},{"key":"7CLWGAM8","version":396,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7CLWGAM8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7CLWGAM8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lin and Wesseh","parsedDate":"2013-06-15","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lin, Boqiang, and Presley K.

This paper therefore attempts to explain the behavior of natural gas index returns and in so doing proposes application of a pure Markov-switching volatility model whose variance is subject to shift in regime. We show that regime-switching is clearly present in the natural gas market and such should not be ignored. All ARCH effects that show up in weekly natural gas index returns data die out almost completely after allowing for Markov-switching variance. Volatility regimes identified by our model correlate well with major events affecting supply and demand for natural gas. Out-of-sample tests indicate that the regime switching model performs noticeably better than a wide range of volatility models considered regardless of evaluation criteria, thus providing a better framework for the policy maker or financial historian interested in studying factors behind the evolution of volatility and to natural gas futures traders interested in short-term volatility forecasts. As risk-hedging decisions rely critically on assumptions about volatility, policies based on the transition probabilities are likely to be more conservative.","publicationTitle":"Energy","volume":"55","issue":"","pages":"553-563","date":"June 15, 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.082","ISSN":"0360-5442","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421300279X","accessDate":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Natural gas price","type":1},{"tag":"Regime-switching","type":1},{"tag":"Volatility forecasts","type":1}],"collections":["42H54TQS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T21:15:21Z"}},{"key":"Z9L68PSA","version":394,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z9L68PSA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z9L68PSA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Flewelling and Sharma","parsedDate":"2014-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Flewelling, Samuel A., and Manu Sharma. &#x201C;Constraints on Upward Migration of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid and Brine.&#x201D; <i>Ground Water</i> 52, no. 1 (February 2014): 9&#x2013;19. https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12095.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"Z9L68PSA","version":394,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Constraints on upward migration of hydraulic fracturing fluid and brine","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel A.","lastName":"Flewelling"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Sharma"}],"abstractNote":"Recent increases in the use of hydraulic fracturing (HF) to aid extraction of oil and gas from black shales have raised concerns regarding potential environmental effects associated with predictions of upward migration of HF fluid and brine. Some recent studies have suggested that such upward migration can be large and that timescales for migration can be as short as a few years. In this article, we discuss the physical constraints on upward fluid migration from black shales (e.g., the Marcellus, Bakken, and Eagle Ford) to shallow aquifers, taking into account the potential changes to the subsurface brought about by HF. Our review of the literature indicates that HF affects a very limited portion of the entire thickness of the overlying bedrock and therefore, is unable to create direct hydraulic communication between black shales and shallow aquifers via induced fractures. As a result, upward migration of HF fluid and brine is controlled by preexisting hydraulic gradients and bedrock permeability. We show that in cases where there is an upward gradient, permeability is low, upward flow rates are low, and mean travel times are long (often >10⁶  years). Consequently, the recently proposed rapid upward migration of brine and HF fluid, predicted to occur as a result of increased HF activity, does not appear to be physically plausible. Unrealistically high estimates of upward flow are the result of invalid assumptions about HF and the hydrogeology of sedimentary basins.","publicationTitle":"Ground Water","volume":"52","issue":"1","pages":"9-19","date":"2014 Jan-Feb","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ground Water","language":"eng","DOI":"10.1111/gwat.12095","ISSN":"1745-6584","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 23895673\nPMCID: PMC4321062","tags":[{"tag":"Extraction and Processing Industry","type":1},{"tag":"Groundwater","type":1},{"tag":"Permeability","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1},{"tag":"Water Movements","type":1},{"tag":"Water Pollution, Chemical","type":1}],"collections":["Q7MVJ2ED"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:56:50Z"}},{"key":"UHM9AELY","version":389,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/UHM9AELY","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/UHM9AELY","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Food & Water Watch","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Food &amp; Water Watch. &#x201C;The Social Costs of Fracking.&#x201D; Food &amp; Water Watch, 2013. https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/social-costs-fracking.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"UHM9AELY","version":389,"itemType":"document","title":"The Social Costs of Fracking","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","name":"Food & Water Watch"}],"abstractNote":"This study is the first detailed, long-term analysis of the social costs of fracking borne by rural Pennsylvania communities.","publisher":"Food & Water Watch","date":"2013","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/social-costs-fracking","accessDate":"2018-04-10T20:53:15Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:53:15Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:54:16Z"}},{"key":"2ZIEDA9B","version":383,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/2ZIEDA9B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/2ZIEDA9B","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Drohan et al.","parsedDate":"2012-05-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Drohan, P.

The northeastern U.S., specifically the Allegheny Plateau in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, is experiencing rapid exploration. Using Pennsylvania as a proxy for regional development across the Plateau, we examine land cover change due to shale-gas exploration, with emphasis on forest fragmentation. Pennsylvania’s shale-gas development is greatest on private land, and is dominated by pads with 1–2 wells; less than 10 % of pads have five wells or more. Approximately 45–62 % of pads occur on agricultural land and 38–54 % in forest land (many in core forest on private land). Development of permits granted as of June 3, 2011, would convert at least 644–1072 ha of agricultural land and 536–894 ha of forest land. Agricultural land conversion suggests that drilling is somewhat competing with food production. Accounting for existing pads and development of all permits would result in at least 649 km of new road, which, along with pipelines, would fragment forest cover. The Susquehanna River basin (feeding the Chesapeake Bay), is most developed, with 885 pads (26 % in core forest); permit data suggests the basin will experience continued heavy development. The intensity of core forest disturbance, where many headwater streams occur, suggests that such streams should become a focus of aquatic monitoring. Given the intense development on private lands, we believe a regional strategy is needed to help guide infrastructure development, so that habitat loss, farmland conversion, and the risk to waterways are better managed.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Management","volume":"49","issue":"5","pages":"1061-1075","date":"2012/05/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Management","language":"en","DOI":"10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","ISSN":"0364-152X, 1432-1009","shortTitle":"Early Trends in Landcover Change and Forest Fragmentation Due to Shale-Gas Development in Pennsylvania","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-012-9841-6","accessDate":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"link.springer.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["M43C6MTF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T20:52:44Z"}},{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7QMSBU8E","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Davis","parsedDate":"2014-08-05","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Davis, Charles. &#x201C;Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?&#x201D; <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> 48, no. 15 (August 5, 2014): 8397&#x2013;8403. https://doi.org/10.1021/es405095y.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"7QMSBU8E","version":380,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Substate Federalism and Fracking Policies: Does State Regulatory Authority Trump Local Land Use Autonomy?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Davis"}],"abstractNote":"State officials responsible for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations used in the production of oil and gas resources will inevitably confront a key policy issue; that is, to what extent can statewide regulations be developed without reducing land use autonomy typically exercised by local officials? Most state regulators have historically recognized the economic importance of industry jobs and favor the adoption of uniform regulatory requirements even if these rules preempt local policymaking authority. Conversely, many local officials seek to preserve land use autonomy to provide a greater measure of protection for public health and environmental quality goals. This paper examines how public officials in three states—Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Texas—address the question of state control versus local autonomy through their efforts to shape fracking policy decisions. While local officials within Texas have succeeded in developing fracking ordinances with relatively little interference from state regulators, Colorado and Pennsylvania have adopted a tougher policy stance favoring the retention of preemptive oil and gas statutes.

The federal Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) rules on how drilling activity can take place on federal lands essentially dicate terms, making BLM the largest “regulator” of drilling activity in the country. BLM last revised its oil and gas regulations (the Onshore Orders) in the 1980s and early 1990s, well before the recent rapid expansion of shale gas development. To date there are two rounds of proposed revisions, the first issued in 2012 and the most recent issued in May 2013, after BLM received 177,000 comments on the first round. This paper examines the 2013 proposal in several key respects, including the scope and requirements of the new proposal, the substantial changes from the 2012 proposal, and a comparison of BLM’s proposed rules with rules in states with shale gas development and significant federal land holdings, based on earlier work. We find that BLM’s proposal addresses some apparent gaps in state-level regulation and that, generally, BLM rules do not appear to impose significant requirements beyond existing state regulations, at least across the regulatory elements we analyzed and in those states with large federal land holdings.","publicationTitle":"SSRN Electronic Journal","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2313246","ISSN":"1556-5068","shortTitle":"Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands","url":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2313246","accessDate":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["SFLUS5I4"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T19:08:31Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T19:08:32Z"}},{"key":"25SN89XJ","version":352,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/25SN89XJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/25SN89XJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4383813,"username":"echarte","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/echarte","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Graham et al.","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Graham, John D., John A.

Drawing on the risk literature, recent opinion surveys, and case studies of regulation in eight states, we find that UGD is an emerging technology that is likely to be perceived as risky, even though the two most commonly claimed risks, water contamination and induced seismicity, appear to be controllable through competent industry and regulatory practices. Perceived risk is likely to increase as the technology is used more widely in the United States but any public outrage is likely to be attenuated because of perceived benefits and related forms of risk compensation for individuals and communities. The types of triggering events necessary for large-scale social amplification and stigmatization have not yet occurred but organized interests against UGD are becoming stronger and are exerting significant influence. It is too early to determine whether UGD will become stigmatized in the same way that nuclear power and genetically modified foods are now stigmatized in some regions of the world.","publicationTitle":"Risk Analysis","volume":"35","issue":"10","pages":"1770-1788","date":"10/2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/risa.12512","ISSN":"02724332","shortTitle":"Unconventional Gas Development in the USA","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/risa.12512","accessDate":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T18:41:05Z"}},{"key":"3KZU4U7G","version":613,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/3KZU4U7G","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/3KZU4U7G","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Peach and Starbuck","parsedDate":"2011","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Peach, James, and C.

Physical and chemical impacts of HVHHF include pollution by toxic synthetic chemicals, salt, and radionuclides, landscape fragmentation by wellpads, pipelines, and roads, alteration of stream and wetland hydrology, and increased truck traffic. Despite concerns about human health, there has been little study of the impacts on habitats and biota. Taxa and guilds potentially sensitive to HVHHF impacts include freshwater organisms (e.g., brook trout, freshwater mussels), fragmentation-sensitive biota (e.g., forest-interior breeding birds, forest orchids), and species with restricted geographic ranges (e.g., Wehrle's salamander, tongue-tied minnow). Impacts are potentially serious due to the rapid development of HVHHF over a large region.","publicationTitle":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","volume":"1286","issue":"","pages":"1-14","date":"May 2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ann.

Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N = 453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.","publicationTitle":"Energy Research & Social Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.007","ISSN":"2214-6296","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Community acceptance"},{"tag":"Pennsylvania impact fees"},{"tag":"Revenue reinvestment"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas development"}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:28Z"}},{"key":"VE75HVTI","version":613,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VE75HVTI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VE75HVTI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Paulik et al.","parsedDate":"2015-04-21","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Paulik, L.

While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state’s economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework. It was determined that the oil boom, as represented by the number of rigs in the state, led to an increase in employment and wages in energy sector, as expected, but also in the rest of the economy. Oil development activity had no significant impact on agricultural wages. Both energy sector equations, employment and wage, suggest relative independence of these variables from the movements in agriculture and the rest of the economy, and being impacted mostly by the changes in energy sector itself. Seasonality does not play significant role in energy sector employment and wages unlike in agriculture and the rest of the economy.","publicationTitle":"Energy Economics","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.10.007","ISSN":"0140-9883","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Dutch disease"},{"tag":"employment"},{"tag":"energy boom"},{"tag":"labor market"},{"tag":"natural resource curse"},{"tag":"oil"},{"tag":"wages"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:33:06Z"}},{"key":"NXI7VHY7","version":273,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/NXI7VHY7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/NXI7VHY7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Metcalf","parsedDate":"2010","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Metcalf, Gilbert E. <i>US Energy Tax Policy</i>.

I examine the impact of the energy boom on the labor market by exploiting a natural experiment in the Marcellus region. In particular, I compare counties with fracking activity in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the control group of counties in New York, which imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking. I look at how the benefits to the labor demand shock are shared between industries as well as how employment and wages in related industries adjust over the course of the resource boom. The results suggest total employment and wages per job increase by 7% and 11% respectively above pre-boom levels in the three years after the boom, but decline after 4 years or more. The results also show significant positive spillovers to related sectors, such as construction, transportation, retail trade and accommodations.

In situ air quality measurements using membrane inlet mobile mass spectrometry revealed ambient benzene and toluene concentrations as high as 1000 and 5000 parts-per-billion, respectively, originating from specific sub-processes on unconventional oil and gas well pad sites. The detection of highly variant contamination events attributable to natural gas flaring units, condensate tanks, compressor units, and hydrogen sulfide scavengers indicates that mechanical inefficiencies, and not necessarily the inherent nature of the extraction process as a whole, result in the release of these compounds into the environment. This awareness of ongoing contamination events contributes to an enhanced knowledge of ambient volatile organic compounds on a regional scale. While these reconnaissance measurements on their own do not fully characterize the fluctuations of ambient BTEX concentrations that likely exist in the atmosphere of the Eagle Ford Shale region, they do suggest that contamination events from unconventional oil and gas development can be monitored, controlled, and reduced.","publicationTitle":"Science of The Total Environment","volume":"573","issue":"","pages":"382-388","date":"12/15/ 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.118","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Air quality"},{"tag":"BTEX"},{"tag":"Eagle Ford"},{"tag":"Mobile mass spectrometry"}],"collections":["FUGV49UB"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:24Z"}},{"key":"62APS6P8","version":673,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/62APS6P8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/62APS6P8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Stephen Herzenberg et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Stephen Herzenberg, Diana Polson, and Mark Price. &#x201C;Measuring the Costs and Benefits of Natural Gas Development in Greene County, Pennsylvania: A Case Study.&#x201D; Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, 2014.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"62APS6P8","version":673,"itemType":"report","title":"Measuring the costs and benefits of natural gas development in Greene County, Pennsylvania: A case study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Stephen Herzenberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Diana Polson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"","lastName":"Mark Price"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center","date":"2014","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:23Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:23Z"}},{"key":"GKWXP2JR","version":576,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GKWXP2JR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GKWXP2JR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Helmig et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Helmig, D., C.

Here we develop a five‐question test to categorize individual events as “tectonic,” “possibly induced,” “probably induced,” or “almost certainly induced.” In Texas, the probably induced and almost certainly induced earthquakes are broadly distributed geographically—in the Fort Worth basin of north Texas, the Haynesville Shale play area of east Texas, along the Gulf Coast in south Texas, and the Permian basin of west Texas. As the technologies applied to manage petroleum fields have evolved, induced earthquakes have been associated with different practices. In fields being driven by primary recovery prior to 1940, earthquakes occurred in fields extracting high volumes of petroleum from shallow strata. Subsequently, as field pressures decreased and secondary recovery technologies became common, earthquakes also occurred in association with waterflooding operations. Since 2008, the rate of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 3 has increased from about 2 events/yr to 12 events/yr; much of this change is attributable to earthquakes occurring within a few kilometers of wastewater disposal wells injecting at high monthly rates. For three sequences monitored by temporary local seismograph networks, most hypocenters had focal depths at and deeper than the depth of injection and occurred along mapped faults situated within 2 km of injection sites.

Our study area consists of two counties in Pennsylvania that are home to large amounts of unconventional natural gas extraction but are otherwise isolated from other resource extraction industries or large urban areas. We deploy parametric, semi-parametric, and matching hedonic regression models that include recent quasi-experimental methods and, in contrast to previous research and much popular intuition, we fail to find robust significance that negative environmental externalities of natural gas extraction are manifested in nearby property values. While there may be plausible risks associated with unconventional natural gas extraction, we do not find consistent evidence to suggest that these risks significantly affect nearby property values.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"1-22","date":"11// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.001","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Environmental costs"},{"tag":"Hedonic analysis"},{"tag":"Marcellus Shale"},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction"}],"collections":["NXSYV4IM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:07Z"}},{"key":"QPTIUSWD","version":547,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/QPTIUSWD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/QPTIUSWD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Considine et al.","parsedDate":"2009","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

We extend this research by examining how geographic proximity to such extraction interacts with political ideology to influence issue support. Regression analysis of data from a fall 2013 national telephone survey of United States residents reveals that as respondents’ geographic distance from areas experiencing significant development increases, political ideology becomes more strongly associated with issue support, with the liberal-partisan divide widening. Our findings support construal level theory's central premise: that people use more abstract considerations (like political ideology) the more geographically removed they are from an issue. We discuss implications for studying public opinion of energy development as well as for risk communication.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"97","issue":"","pages":"301-309","date":"10// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.07.032","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Construal level theory"},{"tag":"Hydraulic fracturing"},{"tag":"Proximity"},{"tag":"Public perception"},{"tag":"Risk communication"},{"tag":"Unconventional oil and gas development"}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:32:00Z"}},{"key":"5PLVFQLQ","version":262,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/5PLVFQLQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/5PLVFQLQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Clayton","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Clayton, Blake C. <i>Market Madness: A Century of Oil Panics, Crises, and Crashes</i>.

Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1–2 percentage points (a 6–11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments.","publicationTitle":"Resource and Energy Economics","volume":"46","issue":"","pages":"23-38","date":"11// 2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2016.07.003","ISSN":"0928-7655","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Mineral rights"},{"tag":"Natural gas"},{"tag":"Oil"},{"tag":"Royalty payments"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:31:54Z"}},{"key":"S48M2RAJ","version":260,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/S48M2RAJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/S48M2RAJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Brasington","parsedDate":"2002","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

We analyze the time-evolution of radiative forcing from both natural gas and coal-based electricity generation by calculating average radiative forcing over an interval of time from greenhouse gas emissions under a range of assumptions for fugitive methane leakage, electricity generation efficiency, and delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We find that leakage rates of between 5.2% and 9.9% are required for natural gas to result in greater mean forcing than coal over the next 100 years. We show that natural gas infrastructure with modest leakage could remain in place for 1.5–2.4 times the time interval that coal generation would have persisted prior to replacement with near-zero carbon technologies before the climate benefits of replacing coal with natural gas are negated. Natural gas can serve a viable bridge away from coal-based generation if avoiding longer-term climate impacts is prioritized, fugitive methane emissions are minimized, and the large-scale transition to near-zero carbon alternatives is unlikely to happen in the near-term.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"86","issue":"","pages":"286-294","date":"November 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.07.012","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300239","accessDate":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Bridge fuel","type":1},{"tag":"Carbon dioxide","type":1},{"tag":"Climate change","type":1},{"tag":"Coal","type":1},{"tag":"Methane","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z","dateModified":"2018-04-08T21:28:19Z"}},{"key":"X5UVGREC","version":566,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/X5UVGREC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/X5UVGREC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goetz et al.","parsedDate":"2017-02-09","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goetz, J.

Experiments were conducted to quantify airborne emissions from twelve samples of hydraulic fracturing flowback wastewater collected in the Permian Basin, as well as the photochemical processing of these emissions leading to the formation of particulate matter. The concentration of total volatile carbon (TVC, hydrocarbons evaporating at room temperature) averaged 29 mg of carbon (C) L-1. After photochemical oxidation under high NOx conditions the amount of organic particulate matter (PM) formed per milliliter of wastewater evaporated averaged 24 µg; the amount of ammonium nitrate formed averaged 262 µg. Based on the mean PM formation observed in these experiments, the estimated formation of PM from evaporated flowback wastewater in the state of Texas is in the range of estimated PM emissions from diesel engines used in oil rigs. Evaporation of flowback wastewater, a hitherto unrecognized source of secondary pollutants, could significantly contribute to ambient PM concentrations.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"March 29, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively.

In the region that is densely populated with oil producing facilities, many localized geohazards, such as ground subsidence and micro-earthquakes, have gone unnoticed. Here we identify the localized geohazards in West Texas, using the satellite radar interferometry from newly launched radar satellites that provide radar images freely to public for the first time, and probe the causal mechanisms of ground deformation, encompassing oil/gas production activities and subsurface geological characteristics. Based on our observations and analyses, human activities of fluid (saltwater, CO2) injection for stimulation of hydrocarbon production, salt dissolution in abandoned oil facilities, and hydrocarbon extraction each have negative impacts on the ground surface and infrastructures, including possible induced seismicity. Proactive continuous and detailed monitoring of ground deformation from space over the currently operating and the previously operated oil/gas production facilities, as demonstrated by this research, is essential to securing the safety of humanity, preserving property, and sustaining the growth of the hydrocarbon production industry.","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"4727","date":"2018-03-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"En","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-23143-6","ISSN":"2045-2322","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23143-6","accessDate":"2018-03-23T12:58:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","callNumber":"","rights":"2018 The Author(s)","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/1352990/items/5EADYE2R"},"dateAdded":"2018-03-23T12:59:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-23T12:59:06Z"}},{"key":"TAGT9H37","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/TAGT9H37","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/TAGT9H37","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zavala-Araiza et al.","parsedDate":"2018-03-22","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zavala-Araiza, Daniel, Scott C.

Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0.4. for residents ≤ ½ mile from wells and >½ mile from wells, respectively. Cumulative cancer risks were 10 in a million and 6 in a million for residents living ≤ ½ mile and >½ mile from wells, respectively, with benzene as the major contributor to the risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk assessment can be used in HIAs to direct health risk prevention strategies. Risk management approaches should focus on reducing exposures to emissions during well completions. These preliminary results indicate that health effects resulting from air emissions during unconventional NGD warrant further study. Prospective studies should focus on health effects associated with air pollution.","publicationTitle":"The Science of the Total Environment","volume":"424","issue":"","pages":"79-87","date":"May 01, 2012","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci.

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.\nThis article investigates the effects of hydraulic fracturing on infant health.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"12","pages":"e1603021","date":"2017/12/01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1603021","ISSN":"2375-2548","shortTitle":"Hydraulic fracturing and infant health","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1603021","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:29:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"advances.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite substantial increases in well drilling, the health consequences of UGOD toxicant exposure remain unclear. This study examines an association between wells and healthcare use by zip code from 2007 to 2011 in Pennsylvania. Inpatient discharge databases from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council were correlated with active wells by zip code in three counties in Pennsylvania. For overall inpatient prevalence rates and 25 specific medical categories, the association of inpatient prevalence rates with number of wells per zip code and, separately, with wells per km2 (separated into quantiles and defined as well density) were estimated using fixed-effects Poisson models. To account for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction with associations of p<0.00096 was considered statistically significant. Cardiology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with number of wells per zip code (p<0.00096) and wells per km2 (p<0.00096) while neurology inpatient prevalence rates were significantly associated with wells per km2 (p<0.00096). Furthermore, evidence also supported an association between well density and inpatient prevalence rates for the medical categories of dermatology, neurology, oncology, and urology. These data suggest that UGOD wells, which dramatically increased in the past decade, were associated with increased inpatient prevalence rates within specific medical categories in Pennsylvania. Further studies are necessary to address healthcare costs of UGOD and determine whether specific toxicants or combinations are associated with organ-specific responses.","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","volume":"10","issue":"7","pages":"e0131093","date":"Jul 15, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","language":"en","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","ISSN":"1932-6203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131093","accessDate":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Cardiology","type":1},{"tag":"Dermatology","type":1},{"tag":"Inpatients","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas","type":1},{"tag":"Neonatology","type":1},{"tag":"Oncology","type":1},{"tag":"Pennsylvania","type":1},{"tag":"Urology","type":1}],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z","dateModified":"2018-03-12T14:12:47Z"}},{"key":"7EHSXI5C","version":121,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/7EHSXI5C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Goh and Ang","parsedDate":"2018-02-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Goh, Tian, and B.

Another approach, the Equal Share (ES) approach, estimates emission reductions based on the change in the share of non-fossil based energy. As the two approaches have some limitations, a more comprehensive approach based on index decomposition analysis (IDA) is proposed as an alternative, together with an extension to quantify substitution amongst non-fossil based sources. A comparison of the assumptions and features of all three approaches is presented. The study finds that IDA is favoured for its ability to identify policy intervention areas beyond a switch to cleaner energy and is well-suited for tracking of progress towards emission reduction targets and analysing future scenarios.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"113","issue":"","pages":"651-662","date":"February 1, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.019","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517307656","accessDate":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Decarbonisation","type":1},{"tag":"Emission reductions","type":1},{"tag":"Index decomposition analysis","type":1},{"tag":"LMDI","type":1},{"tag":"Paasche index","type":1},{"tag":"Renewable energy","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-05T15:13:10Z"}},{"key":"4R58CTPH","version":1894,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/4R58CTPH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/4R58CTPH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":5043948,"username":"meng_xing24","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/meng_xing24","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Boslett et al.","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

Since 2008, a rapid increase in Marcellus Shale gas production has led to a commensurate rise in associated wastewater while generation of produced water from conventional oil and gas activities has continued. In this study, we assess whether disposal practices from treatment of produced waters from both shale gas and conventional operations in Pennsylvania could result in the accumulation of associated alkali earth elements. The results from our 5 study sites indicate that there was no increase in concentrations of total Ra (Ra-226) and extractable Ba, Ca, Na, or Sr in fluvial sediments downstream of the discharge outfalls (p>0.05) of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and centralized waste treatment facilities (CWTs). However, the use of road spreading of brines from conventional oil and gas wells for deicing resulted in accumulation of Ra-226 (1.2×), and extractable Sr (3.0×), Ca (5.3×), and Na (6.2×) in soil and sediment proximal to roads (p<0.05). Although this study is an important initial assessment of the impacts of these disposal practices, more work is needed to consider the environmental consequences of produced waters management.","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Coal Geology","volume":"126","issue":"","pages":"162-170","date":"June 1, 2014","series":"Environmental geology and the unconventional gas revolution","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Coal Geology","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.coal.2013.12.001","ISSN":"0166-5162","shortTitle":"Surface disposal of produced waters in western and southwestern Pennsylvania","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516213002681","accessDate":"2018-02-12T15:17:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Conventional gas extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental impact","type":1},{"tag":"Produced waters disposal","type":1},{"tag":"Sediment contaminant","type":1},{"tag":"Unconventional gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":["QCW37PP2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"6HSSBUIL","version":620,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/6HSSBUIL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/6HSSBUIL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ratledge and Zachary","parsedDate":"2017-08-10","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ratledge, Nathan, and Laura Zachary. &#x201C;Impacts of Unconventional Oil and Gas Booms on Public Education: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Six Producing States.&#x201D; Resources for the Future, August 10, 2017. http://www.rff.org/research/publications/impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-booms-public-education-mixed-methods.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"6HSSBUIL","version":620,"itemType":"report","title":"Impacts of Unconventional Oil and Gas Booms on Public Education: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Six Producing States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Ratledge"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Zachary"}],"abstractNote":"Unconventional oil and gas development has revolutionized the global energy marketplace, particularly in the United States. Rapid industry expansion has also had significant and widespread impacts at the community level. This study provides an in-depth look at pre-K–12 educational impacts across six oil- and gas-producing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Colorado—to understand the benefits and challenges of the recent resource booms on student enrollment, teachers, public education finances, and student achievement metrics. Understanding the effects of such booms on public education is significant in the short and long term, notably because of their potential influence on educational achievement, career-based decisionmaking, and subsequently, the economic health of a community. A mixed-methods design, coupling difference-in-difference statistical analysis with extensive interviews, reveals a series of key insights across and within states. Broadly, we find divergent trends in student enrollment, student-teacher ratios, and per pupil revenue and expenses between school districts in the eastern versus western United States. In contrast to much of the existing literature, interviews across all regions reported minimal concern with increased dropout rates. Stress from financial uncertainty was also acute and common across all boom districts. Taken together, this analysis underscores the importance of the mixed-methods approach and cautions against overgeneralization of effects across disparate boom regions.","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Resources for the Future","date":"August 10, 2017","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.rff.org/research/publications/impacts-unconventional-oil-and-gas-booms-public-education-mixed-methods","accessDate":"2017-10-27","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9UZR9QKU","version":611,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9UZR9QKU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9UZR9QKU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Papyrakis and Gerlagh","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Papyrakis, Elissaios, and Reyer Gerlagh. &#x201C;Resource Abundance and Economic Growth in the United States.&#x201D; <i>European Economic Review</i> 51, no. 4 (May 0): 1011&#x2013;39. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2006.04.001.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"9UZR9QKU","version":611,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Resource abundance and economic growth in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elissaios","lastName":"Papyrakis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Reyer","lastName":"Gerlagh"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"European Economic Review","volume":"51","issue":"4","pages":"1011-1039","date":"5","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2006.04.001","ISSN":"0014-2921","shortTitle":"Resource abundance and economic growth in the United States","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292106000614","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Growth"},{"tag":"Natural resources"},{"tag":"Transmission channels"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"IKQJWF2Z","version":610,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/IKQJWF2Z","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/IKQJWF2Z","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ouedraogo","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ouedraogo, Abdoulaye. &#x201C;Local Economic Impact of Boom and Bust in Mineral Resource Extraction in the United States: A Spatial Econometrics Analysis.&#x201D; <i>Resources Policy</i> 50 (December 0): 292&#x2013;305. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.09.009.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"IKQJWF2Z","version":610,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Local economic impact of boom and bust in mineral resource extraction in the United States: A spatial econometrics analysis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Abdoulaye","lastName":"Ouedraogo"}],"abstractNote":"This paper examines how shocks in the U.S. mineral resource extraction (MRE) industry impact MRE-dependent counties using county level data between 1970- and 2012. A difference-in-difference fixed effects model and a spatial modeling to incorporate spatial heterogeneity and dependence among U.S. local areas that are in close geographical proximity are employed in this study. The results show that MRE industry employment grew faster during boom periods and slower during the bust period in MRE dependent counties. MRE earnings and earnings per worker grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. The findings give evidence of negative spatial indirect spillover effects between neighboring counties’ MRE sector labor markets. An analysis of the effect of shocks in the MRE sector on the non-MRE sectors shows that in MRE dependent counties non-MRE sector employment grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. Positive shocks in the MRE sector had no effect on the manufacturing sector labor market; however, negative shocks had a positively effect. Booms in the MRE sector positively impacted the construction sector, while negatively affecting the service and retail trade sectors’ labor markets in MRE dependent counties. Finally, this study finds that male population grew faster, while female population grew slower in the MRE dependent counties.","publicationTitle":"Resources Policy","volume":"50","issue":"","pages":"292-305","date":"12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.09.009","ISSN":"0301-4207","shortTitle":"Local economic impact of boom and bust in mineral resource extraction in the United States: A spatial econometrics analysis","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716302434","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Boom and bust"},{"tag":"Local economic impact"},{"tag":"Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE)"}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"77TVQTBT","version":600,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/77TVQTBT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/77TVQTBT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Mayer et al.","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Mayer, Adam, Shawn K.

However, empirical evidence is limited. In this article, we consider the socioeconomic effects (particularly, related to poverty, employment, income, and wages) of unconventional oil and gas extraction using a national data set of U.S. counties. We use a novel between- and within-county random effects modeling strategy to capture both resource curse and boomtown dynamics. Further, we allow the effect of oil and gas development to be conditioned by county rurality. Broadly, our findings suggest that oil and gas development has very complex effects at the county level. Within-county growth in oil and gas production slightly improves most economic outcomes, but counties that specialize in oil and gas development tend to perform worse than other counties. We find that, in general, the effect of within-county oil and gas production is not significantly moderated by county rurality.","publicationTitle":"Rural Sociology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"n/a-n/a","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Rural Sociology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/ruso.12198","ISSN":"1549-0831","shortTitle":"Fracking Fortunes","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ruso.12198/abstract","accessDate":"2017-12-18T15:46:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE","V538Y7T9"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9VEVNEV7","version":599,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9VEVNEV7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9VEVNEV7","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Marchand","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35;

From 1988 onward, Alaskan oil production steadily declined. The temporal characteristics of the Alaskan oil boom make for an ideal case study of the economic effects of resource booms more generally. The boom generated significant short-run economic gains that were quickly diluted by inward migration. In the long run though, the income gains may have turned into losses.

In a review of six such impact reports, Kinnaman (2011) speculates about several major issues worth scrutiny arising with analysis using input-output models. His central critique focuses on the assumptions of how industry spending is represented and how leasing and royalty dollars are spent. In this study, we use detailed county records and results from a survey to directly address these assumptions, and compare our results to the findings in an economic impact study of Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania which Kinnaman critiqued. Our results, which are only about 52% of the prior study, confirm his supposition that some ex ante studies use unrealistic assumptions which lead to gross overestimates of the impacts.","publicationTitle":"Ecological Economics","volume":"138","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"178-185","date":"August 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.03.037","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915306704","accessDate":"2017-11-14T18:27:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Economic impacts","type":1},{"tag":"Input-output models","type":1},{"tag":"Natural gas extraction","type":1}],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"VV9A873D","version":577,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/VV9A873D","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/VV9A873D","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Herzenberg et al.","parsedDate":"2014","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Herzenberg, Stephen, Diana Polson, and Mark Price. &#x201C;Measuring the Costs and Benefits of Natural Gas Development in Greene County, Pennsylvania: A Case Study.&#x201D; Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, 2014. https://pennbpc.org/sites/pennbpc.org/files/greeneCASESTUDY.pdf.</div>\n</div>","data":{"key":"VV9A873D","version":577,"itemType":"report","title":"Measuring the costs and benefits of natural gas development in Greene County, Pennsylvania: A case study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Herzenberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Polson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Price"}],"abstractNote":"","reportNumber":"","reportType":"","seriesTitle":"","place":"","institution":"Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center","date":"2014","pages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"Measuring the costs and benefits of natural gas development in Greene County, Pennsylvania: A case study","url":"https://pennbpc.org/sites/pennbpc.org/files/greeneCASESTUDY.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["X9DSTIGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"R6TYMTWL","version":571,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/R6TYMTWL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/R6TYMTWL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Hardy and Kelsey","parsedDate":"2015","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Hardy, Kirsten, and TimothyW Kelsey. &#x201C;The Shale Gas Economy in the Northeast Pennsylvania Counties.&#x201D; In <i>Economics of Unconventional Shale Gas Development</i>, edited by William E.

This article documents evidence that the Resource Curse extends to the individual states of the US Using a variety of specifications, regression of state GSP growth on resource intensity consistently shows a negative and significant relationship. There is evidence that crowding out of the manufacturing sector may contribute to the slower growth of resource-based economies.

Since 2009, earthquake activity in the CUS has increased markedly, and numerous publications suggest that this increase is primarily due to induced earthquakes caused by deep-well injection of wastewater, both flowback water from hydrofracturing operations and produced water accompanying hydrocarbon production. Alternatively, some argue that these earthquakes are natural and that the seismicity increase is a normal variation that occurs over millions of years. Our analysis shows that within the NME, faults deform both Quaternary alluvium and underlying sediments dating from Paleozoic through Tertiary, with displacement increasing with geologic unit age, documenting a long history of natural activity. In the FWB, a region of ongoing wastewater injection, basement faults show deformation of the Proterozoic and Paleozoic units, but little or no deformation of younger strata. Specifically, vertical displacements in the post-Pennsylvanian formations, if any, are below the resolution (~15 m) of the seismic data, far less than expected had these faults accumulated deformation over millions of years. Our results support the assertion that recent FWB earthquakes are of induced origin; this conclusion is entirely independent of analyses correlating seismicity and wastewater injection practices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to discriminate natural and induced seismicity using classical structural geology analysis techniques.","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","volume":"3","issue":"11","pages":"","date":"November 1, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Adv","language":"","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1701593","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701593.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"47DJY6VU","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/47DJY6VU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/47DJY6VU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Yoon et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-01","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Yoon, Clara E., Yihe Huang, William L.

There have been multiple reports of air and water contamination by volatile organic compounds in the vicinity of gas wells. Although these chemicals are known developmental toxicants, no biomonitoring effort has been carried out in the region.\nObjective\nTo evaluate gestational exposure to benzene and toluene in the Peace River Valley, Northeastern British Columbia (Canada).\nMethods\nUrine samples were collected over five consecutive days from 29 pregnant women. Metabolites of benzene (s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA)) and toluene (s-benzylmercapturic acid (S-BMA)) were measured in pooled urine samples from each participant. Levels of benzene metabolites were compared to those from the general Canadian population and from a biomonitoring study of residents from an area of active gas exploitation in Pavillion, Wyoming (USA). Levels measured in participants from the two recruitment sites, and self-identifying as Indigenous or non-Indigenous, were also compared.\nResults\nWhereas the median S-PMA level (0.18 μg/g creatinine) in our study was similar to that in the general Canadian population, the median t,t-MA level (180 μg/g creatinine) was approximately 3.5 times higher. Five women had t,t-MA levels above the biological exposure index® proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The median urinary S-BMA level in our pilot study was 7.00 μg/g creatinine. Urinary metabolite levels were slightly higher in self-identifying Indigenous women, but this difference was only statistically significant for S-PMA.\nDiscussion\nUrinary t,t-MA levels, but not S-PMA levels, measured in our study are suggestive of a higher benzene exposure in participating pregnant women from the Peace River Valley than in the general Canadian population. Given the small sample size and limitations of t,t-MA measurements (e.g., non-specificity), more extensive monitoring is warranted.","publicationTitle":"Environment International","volume":"110","issue":"","pages":"131-138","date":"January 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environment International","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.022","ISSN":"0160-4120","shortTitle":"Gestational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017310309","accessDate":"2017-11-14T14:05:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9GDUZ58L","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9GDUZ58L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Worden et al.","parsedDate":"2017-12-20","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Worden, John R., A.

Some recent estimates of leakage have challenged the benefits of switching from coal to NG, a large near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunity (1–3).

As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations. Abundant natural gas can, however, help reduce the costs of achieving GHG reduction goals.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"48","issue":"15","pages":"8360-8368","date":"August 5, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a 23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process. Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that prenatal UOG-MIX exposures would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland. Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to approximately 3, 30, 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX from gestational day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females prior to puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX developed more dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 μg/kg/day UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-MIX-treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds, i.e., highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty. These results suggest that the mammary gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in unconventional oil and gas production, at exposure levels that are environmentally relevant. The impact of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.","publicationTitle":"Endocrinology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Endocrinology","language":"en","DOI":"10.1210/en.2017-00866","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://academic.oup.com/endo/advance-article/doi/10.1210/en.2017-00866/4841948","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:56:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"academic.oup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["5W2ZJTJC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"Z3E8ZM4W","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/Z3E8ZM4W","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/Z3E8ZM4W","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Barkley et al.","parsedDate":"2017-11-23","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Barkley, Zachary R., Thomas Lauvaux, Kenneth J.

These top-down measurements were directly compared with region-specific bottom-up inventories that utilized current industry-reported flaring and venting volumes (reported data) and quantitative estimates of unreported venting and fugitive sources. For the 50 × 50 km measurement region near Red Deer, characterized by natural gas and light oil production, measured methane fluxes were more than 17 times greater than that derived from directly reported data but consistent with our region-specific bottom-up inventory-based estimate. For the 60 × 60 km measurement region near Lloydminster, characterized by significant cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS), airborne measured methane fluxes were five times greater than directly reported emissions from venting and flaring and four times greater than our region-specific bottom up inventory-based estimate. Extended across Alberta, our results suggest that reported venting emissions in Alberta should be 2.5 ± 0.5 times higher, and total methane emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector (excluding mined oil sands) are likely at least 25–50% greater than current government estimates. Successful mitigation efforts in the Red Deer region will need to focus on the >90% of methane emissions currently unmeasured or unreported.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"October 17, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

This article explores global and country-specific effects of increasing global shale gas exploitation on the energy markets, on greenhouse gas emissions, and on mitigation costs. The global techno-economic partial equilibrium model POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems) is employed to compare policies which limit global warming to 2°C and baseline scenarios when the availability of shale gas is either high or low. According to the simulation results, a high availability of shale gas has rather small effects on the costs of meeting climate targets in the medium and long term. In the long term, a higher availability of shale gas increases baseline emissions of greenhouse gases for most countries and for the world, and leads to higher compliance costs for most, but not all, countries. Allowing for global trading of emission certificates does not alter these general results. In sum, these findings cast doubt on shale gas’s potential as a low-cost option for meeting ambitious global climate targets.POLICY RELEVANCEMany countries with a large shale gas resource base consider the expansion of local shale gas extraction as an option to reduce their GHG emissions. The findings in this article imply that a higher availability of shale gas in these countries might actually increase emissions and mitigation costs for these countries and also for the world. An increase in shale gas extraction may spur a switch from coal to gas electricity generation, thus lowering emissions. At the global level and for many countries, though, this effect is more than offset by a crowding out of renewable and nuclear energy carriers, and by lower energy prices, leading to higher emissions and higher mitigation costs in turn. These findings would warrant a re-evaluation of the climate strategy in most countries relying on the exploitation of shale gas to meet their climate targets.","publicationTitle":"Climate Policy","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-17","date":"April 10, 2017","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","ISSN":"1469-3062","shortTitle":"","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1302917","accessDate":"2017-10-26T12:59:20Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Climate policy","type":1},{"tag":"energy prices","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"mitigation costs","type":1},{"tag":"shale gas","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"FVSF3SZC","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FVSF3SZC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FVSF3SZC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Schneising et al.","parsedDate":"2014-10-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Schneising, Oliver, John P.

In North America, these unconventional domestic sources of natural gas and oil provide an opportunity to achieve energy self-sufficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when displacing coal as a source of energy in power plants. However, fugitive methane emissions in the production process may counter the benefit over coal with respect to climate change and therefore need to be well quantified. Here we demonstrate that positive methane anomalies associated with the oil and gas industries can be detected from space and that corresponding regional emissions can be constrained using satellite observations. On the basis of a mass-balance approach, we estimate that methane emissions for two of the fastest growing production regions in the United States, the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, have increased by 990 ± 650 ktCH4 yr−1 and 530 ± 330 ktCH4 yr−1 between the periods 2006–2008 and 2009–2011. Relative to the respective increases in oil and gas production, these emission estimates correspond to leakages of 10.1% ± 7.3% and 9.1% ± 6.2% in terms of energy content, calling immediate climate benefit into question and indicating that current inventories likely underestimate the fugitive emissions from Bakken and Eagle Ford.","publicationTitle":"Earth's Future","volume":"2","issue":"10","pages":"2014EF000265","date":"October 1, 2014","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Earth's Future","language":"en","DOI":"10.1002/2014EF000265","ISSN":"2328-4277","shortTitle":"","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EF000265/abstract","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:30:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"1610 Atmosphere","type":1},{"tag":"1616 Climate variability","type":1},{"tag":"3360 Remote sensing","type":1},{"tag":"6324 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"6615 Legislation and regulations","type":1},{"tag":"fugitive emissions","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas","type":1},{"tag":"hydraulic fracturing","type":1},{"tag":"oil and gas production","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"9CN9PXBB","version":570,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/9CN9PXBB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/9CN9PXBB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Gravelle and Lachapelle","parsedDate":"2015-08-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Gravelle, Timothy B., and Erick Lachapelle. &#x201C;Politics, Proximity and the Pipeline: Mapping Public Attitudes toward Keystone XL.&#x201D; <i>Energy Policy</i> 83, no.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route. The policy implications of these findings for energy infrastructure siting controversies are discussed.","publicationTitle":"Energy Policy","volume":"83","issue":"Supplement C","pages":"99-108","date":"August 1, 2015","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","language":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2015.04.004","ISSN":"0301-4215","shortTitle":"Politics, proximity and the pipeline","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515001469","accessDate":"2017-10-27T12:36:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Keystone XL","type":1},{"tag":"NIMBY","type":1},{"tag":"Oil","type":1},{"tag":"Pipelines","type":1},{"tag":"Public opinion","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial analysis","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":["YJDYU9VM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"YM4Z79DB","version":196,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/YM4Z79DB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Snee and Zoback","parsedDate":"2018-02-02","numChildren":1},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Snee, Jens-Erik Lund, and Mark D.

In recent years, seismicity has been concentrated near Pecos, Texas; around the Dagger Draw Field, New Mexico; and near the Cogdell Field, Snyder, Texas. We have collected hundreds of measurements of stress orientation and relative magnitude to identify potentially active normal, normal/strike-slip, or strike-slip faults that might be susceptible to earthquake triggering in this region. In the Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform, the faulting regime is consistently normal/strike slip, and the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) is approximately east–west, although modest rotations of the SHmax direction are seen in some areas. Within the Delaware Basin, however, a large-magnitude clockwise rotation (∼150°) of SHmax occurs progressively from being nearly north–south in the north to east-southeast–west-northwest...","publicationTitle":"The Leading Edge","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2018-02-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1190/tle37020127.1","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"State of stress in the Permian Basin, Texas and New Mexico","url":"https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle37020127.1","accessDate":"2018-02-08T13:57:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"world","libraryCatalog":"library.seg.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["FWMYGUWI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"8A7KDRCZ","version":596,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8A7KDRCZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8A7KDRCZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Lauer et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01-04","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Lauer, Nancy E., Nathaniel R.

While this practice was largely discontinued in 2011 for unconventional Marcellus OGW, it continues for conventional OGW. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental implications of the policy allowing the disposal of conventional OGW. We collected stream sediments from three discharge sites receiving treated OGW between 2014-2017 and measured 228Ra, 226Ra, and their decay products, 228Th and 210Pb, respectively. We consistently found elevated activities of 228Ra and 226Ra in stream sediments in the vicinity of the outfall (total Ra = 90-25,000 Bq/kg) compared to upstream sediments (20-80 Bq/kg). In 2015 and 2017, 228Th/228Ra activity ratios in sediments from two disposal sites were relatively low (0.2-0.7), indicating that a portion of the Ra has accumulated in the sediments in recent (<3) years, when no unconventional Marcellus OGW was reportedly discharged. 228Ra/226Ra activity ratios were also higher than what would be expected solely from disposal of low 228Ra/226Ra Marcellus OGW. Based on these variations, we concluded that recent disposal of treated conventional OGW is the source of high Ra in stream sediments at CWT facility disposal sites. Consequently, policies pertaining to the disposal of only unconventional fluids are not adequate in preventing radioactive contamination in sediments at disposal sites, and the permission to release of treated Ra-rich conventional OGW through CWT facilities should be reconsidered.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 4, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (1984–2009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y−1 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance. A range of sensitivity tests suggests that these results are robust.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"113","issue":"39","pages":"10791-10796","date":"09/27/2016","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","language":"en","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1522923113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10791","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:37:39Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"www.pnas.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 27621453","tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian inversion","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric methane","type":1},{"tag":"greenhouse gas emissions","type":1},{"tag":"methane isotopic composition","type":1},{"tag":"methane trends","type":1}],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"GS5Z8M5J","version":182,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/GS5Z8M5J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Ravikumar et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01-19","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Ravikumar, Arvind P., Jingfan Wang, Mike McGuire, Clay S.

A key feature of recent methane mitigation policies is the use of periodic leak detection surveys, typically done with optical gas imaging (OGI) technologies. The most common OGI technology is an infrared camera. In this work, we experimentally develop detection probability curves for OGI-based methane leak detection under different environmental and imaging conditions. Controlled single blind leak detection tests show that the median detection limit (50% detection likelihood) for FLIR-camera based OGI technology is about 20 g CH4/h at an imaging distance of 6 m, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported estimates of 1.4 g CH4/h. Furthermore, we show that median and 90% detection likelihood limit follows a power-law relationship with imaging distance. Finally, we demonstrate that real-world marginal effectiveness of methane mitigation through periodic surveys approaches zero as leak detection sensitivity improves. For example, a median detection limit of 100 g CH4/h is sufficient to detect the maximum amount of leakage that is possible through periodic surveys. Policy makers should take note of these limits while designing equivalence metrics for next-generation leak detection technologies that can trade sensitivity for cost without affecting mitigation priorities.","publicationTitle":"Environmental Science & Technology","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"January 19, 2018","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate sensitive sources. We reconstruct the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4-sink caused the [CH4]-plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn’t resume to cause the renewed [CH4]-rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4-emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.","publicationTitle":"Science","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"aad2705","date":"2016/03/10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1126/science.aad2705","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","shortTitle":"","url":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad2705","accessDate":"2017-11-13T20:36:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"science.sciencemag.org","callNumber":"","rights":"Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science","extra":"PMID: 26966190","tags":[],"collections":["CMPFGPRK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"API7KJCA","version":671,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/API7KJCA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/API7KJCA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Smith and Lee","parsedDate":"2017-09-01","numChildren":2},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Smith, James L., and Thomas K.

To investigate race and poverty in areas where oil and gas wastewater disposal wells, which are used to permanently inject wastewater from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations, are permitted., Methods. With location data of oil and gas disposal wells permitted between 2007 and 2014 in the Eagle Ford area, a region of intensive fracking in southern Texas, we analyzed the racial composition of residents living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well and those farther away, adjusting for rurality and poverty, using a Poisson regression., Results. The proportion of people of color living less than 5 kilometers from a disposal well was 1.3 times higher than was the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites. Adjusting for rurality, disposal wells were 2.04 times (95% confidence interval = 2.02, 2.06) as common in areas with 80% people of color or more than in majority White areas. Disposal wells are also disproportionately sited in high-poverty areas., Conclusions. Wastewater disposal wells in southern Texas are disproportionately permitted in areas with higher proportions of people of color and residents living in poverty, a pattern known as “environmental injustice.”","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","volume":"106","issue":"3","pages":"550-556","date":"2016-3","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Public Health","language":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.303000","ISSN":"0090-0036","shortTitle":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816143/","accessDate":"2018-01-31T22:01:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"PMID: 26794166\nPMCID: PMC4816143","tags":[],"collections":["X5ZEDSMQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"FZ96QAIX","version":19,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/FZ96QAIX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/FZ96QAIX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Zuckerman","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Zuckerman, Gregory. <i>The Frackers: The Outrageous Inside Story of the New Billionaire Wildcatters</i>.

This article illustrates how countries dependent on point source natural resources (those extracted from a narrow geographic or economic base, such as oil and minerals) and plantation crops are predisposed to heightened economic and social divisions and weakened institutional capacity. This in turn impedes their ability to respond effectively to shocks, which previous studies have shown to be essential for sustaining rising levels of prosperity. Analysis of data on classifications of export structure, controlling for a wide array of other potential determinants of governance, shows that point source– and coffee and cocoa–exporting countries do relatively poorly across an array of governance indicators. These governance effects are not associated simply with being a natural resource exporter. Countries with natural resource exports that are diffuse—relying primarily on livestock and agricultural produce from small family farms—do not show the same strong effects—and have had more robust growth recoveries.","publicationTitle":"The World Bank Economic Review","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"141-174","date":"January 1, 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1093/wber/lhi010","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"The Varieties of Resource Experience: Natural Resource Export Structures and the Political Economy of Economic Growth","url":"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/141.abstract","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z","dateModified":"2018-02-26T13:52:15Z"}},{"key":"8PCU37LU","version":7,"library":{"type":"group","id":2127948,"name":"SHARC","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/2127948/items/8PCU37LU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/sharc/items/8PCU37LU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4157873,"username":"danielraimi","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/danielraimi","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Humphreys et al.","parsedDate":"2007","numChildren":0},"bib":"<div class=\"csl-bib-body\" style=\"line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;\">\n  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Humphreys, Macartan, Jeffrey Sachs, and Joseph E Stiglitz. <i>Escaping the Resource Curse</i>.
